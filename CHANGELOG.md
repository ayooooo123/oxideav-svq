# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Decoder::output_video_dimensions` / `output_pixel_format`: SVQ1
  reports the size of the frame `receive_frame` last returned; SVQ3 the
  `SEQH` size every picture is cropped to. Both `Yuv420P`.

### Changed

- Package metadata: the description now names the SVQ3 decoder;
  `tests/` and `fuzz/` are excluded from the published package.

### Fixed

- svq3: the intra 4×4 luma DC is an ordinary coefficient
  (`level × dequant[q]`, spec/06 §4 — its worked instance, +1 at
  quantiser 13 adding 3 to the block, is a test); the wiki-era fixed
  `13·13·1538` inline intra DC scale is removed
  (`dequantize_transform_intra_luma_block`, `dequantize_intra_luma_dc`,
  `INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE*`, `reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs_intra_dc`).
- svq3: every residual list ends at its code number 0 (spec/06 §2) —
  a full block still carries the terminator and a further coefficient
  is the §5 bound error; the alternate-scan block is two consecutive
  lists from positions 0 and 8, neither capped at eight coefficients
  (spec/07 §8).
- svq3: the chroma section is Cb DC, Cr DC, then the eight AC blocks
  (spec/07 §6 items 5–6, §7 items 6–7, spec/08 §6) — not per plane.
- svq3: an I-slice intra 4×4 macroblock carries no quantiser delta; the
  intra 16×16 delta is always present, in every slice type (spec/07
  §9); the delta updates the running quantiser in place.
- svq3: `intra16x16_pred_mode` binds 0 = DC, 1 = vertical,
  2 = horizontal, 3 = plane (spec/07 §10.1); directional modes at the
  picture edge are `Error::MissingIntraNeighbour`.
- svq3: the 16×16 plane predictor is fixture-pinned: H.264's eight-tap
  gradients including the above-left corner, transposed (top gradient
  down `y`, left gradient across `x`), at half H.264's scale
  (`(G + 16) >> 5`); the spec/01 Gap 4 prose formula (seven taps, no
  corner, `(5G + 32) >> 6`) mis-predicts three of the 240×128 sync
  frame's seven plane macroblocks.
- svq3: the chroma DC predictor follows H.264's per-quadrant rule —
  the top-right quadrant prefers the top row, the bottom-left the
  left column (spec/01 Gap 4 "exactly as H.264 chroma DC";
  fixture-pinned, 2016 Cb samples of the 240×128 sync frame).
- svq3: macroblock type code numbers are per slice type (spec/07 §5):
  I slices carry only 0 (intra 4×4) and 1…24 (intra 16×16, record
  `c − 1`); P slices 0…7 inter, 8 intra 4×4, 9…32 intra 16×16 and 33
  the flat-128 intra type; B slices 0…3, 4, 5…28. The former I-slice
  "separate-DC-only" type 25 does not exist (`IntraMbKind` replaces
  `IFrameMbType`; `Svq3MbType::Intra` replaces the per-slice
  `IIntra` / `PIntra` / `BIntra` arms).
- svq3: intra 4×4 prediction modes use the decoder's numbering
  (spec/07 §10.2, spec/01 Gap 3 round 6): 0 = DC, 1 = vertical,
  2 = horizontal, 3 = diagonal-down-right, 4 = the averaged diagonal —
  not H.264's. A pair code resolves into two *ranks* (blocks `2i`,
  `2i + 1` in quadrant-major order) and a rank into a mode through
  `tables/08` with context values 0 (unavailable), `mode + 1` (intra
  4×4 neighbour) or 1 (any other decoded block); an illegal
  `(context, rank)` is `Error::InvalidIntraPrediction`.
- svq3: modes 1–4 require their neighbour blocks and are a bitstream
  error (`Error::MissingIntraNeighbour`) without them — the decoder
  reads no substitute; only DC has the 128 fallback. The
  reconstruction entry points (`reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock*`,
  `Svq3Picture::reconstruct_intra_macroblock_into` /
  `reconstruct_intra_frame`) now return `Result`.
- svq3: the P-slice precision selector follows spec/08 §3's
  enabled-set forms (`0` / `10` / `11` with all three precisions, a
  single index bit with one sub-pel precision, no bits with full-pel
  only).
- svq3: the universal code's bit layout is `0 d₁ 0 d₂ … 0 dₙ 1` — a
  marker bit *before* every data bit, closed by a `1` (spec/06 §1 /
  spec/07 §1, docs round 6). The earlier reader placed the first data
  bit after two leading zeros, which agreed only for code numbers 0,
  2, 3 and 4; every macroblock-layer element read through it was
  affected (`read_universal_code`, every test packer).
- svq3: the `SEQH` flag group is parsed bit for bit per spec/02 §3 —
  `postfilter_hint` (bit 3), `extended_mode` (bit 4), the two
  reserved `1`s, `no_b_frames`, the reserved `0`, the bit-9 escape
  for further data bytes and the `protected` flag (bit 10); the
  earlier parser folded bits 3–6 into `unknown4` and took bit 8 as the
  escape. `frame_size_code` 5 selects SVQ3's own `1152 × 1408`
  (spec/02 §2), not the SVQ1 table's slot.
- svq3: the slice header follows spec/07 §3.1/§3.2 — `encrypted` (type
  1) or `first_mb` with `N = max(6, ⌈log₂(mb_count + 1)⌉)` (type 2),
  `picture_id`, `qp`, `mb_qp_delta_enable`, the unassigned flag, the
  protected-only bit, `mode` (which must echo `SEQH` bit 4), the
  reserved `u(2)`, then the extension-byte loop. The two "reserved bits
  closing the header" of r450 were the `mode` bit plus the reserved
  pair read before the loop terminator, not after it.

### Added

- fuzz: `svq3_access_units` (I + P access-unit chains through
  `Svq3PictureDecoder`, filter on and off, every partition shape and
  sub-pel phase) and `svq3_filter_mc` (the edge filter and motion
  compensation over arbitrary planes and vectors). Bounded runs of
  every SVQ3 target found two defects fixed in the same round —
  motion-vector differences near the i32 limits overflowed the
  predictor add / stored multiply (now saturating, with the picture
  clamp and motion-compensation origins computed in i64), and the edge
  filter read one sample past a plane whose size is 1 mod 4 (an edge
  whose `q1` falls outside is skipped; the decoder's own canvases are
  macroblock-aligned) — both with regression tests.
- svq3: `Svq3PictureDecoder`, `Svq3DecodeOptions` and
  `Svq3DecodedPicture` are re-exported at the crate root as the direct
  SVQ3 decode API alongside the registry `make_svq3_decoder`.
- svq3: the P-slice inter macroblock layer of spec/08 — the skip type's
  zero-motion copy (§5); for types 1…7 the precision selector (§3),
  one motion-vector-difference pair per partition (vertical first,
  §4.1) added to the median predictor of the left / above /
  above-right (or above-left) blocks with the picture clamp (§4.3),
  converted per precision and stored in sixths (§4.2); motion
  compensation of luma and chroma through every spec/05 §4 kernel
  (`svq3_mc::motion_compensate_block` — full copy, half-pel bilinear,
  third-pel one- and two-dimensional with weight 4 on the nearest
  corner; chroma at half the luma vector,
  `motion_compensate_chroma_block`); then the inter-table pattern, the
  conditional quantiser delta and the normal-zigzag residual (§6).
  Intra 4×4 / 16×16 / flat-128 macroblocks inside P slices share the
  intra grammar with their P-slice delta rules; macroblocks a P slice
  leaves uncoded are copied from the reference (§7). **Every access
  unit of both fixtures — 10/10 — now decodes byte-exact on every
  plane** against the unfiltered reference, and with the filter on the
  320×240 stream's AU3 matches the component's own picture (SHA-256
  `cf9ec710700a…`). The registry decoder emits P pictures.
- svq3: the intra-picture edge filter of spec/09 (`svq3_filter`): after
  every I picture each plane's 4-sample block edges are smoothed by up
  to `limit[quantiser]` (`tables/09`; luma with the quantiser in force
  after the last macroblock, chroma with its remapped index) —
  vertical edges first, then horizontal, `delta = trunc((4(q0 − p0) +
  (p1 − q1)) / 8)` clipped to `±limit`. On by default
  (`Svq3DecodeOptions::intra_edge_filter`, also
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::set_options`): the filtered picture is displayed
  and referenced, as in the vendor decoder; off, the decoder yields the
  unfiltered reconstruction the fixtures' `expected.yuv` holds. Pinned
  by the fixture harness: the 320×240 stream's second sync frame
  filtered matches the component's own picture (SHA-256
  `7f07e2acc656…`, spec/09 §6), its first sync frame and the 240×128
  stream are unchanged by the pass.
- svq3: `Svq3PictureDecoder` (`svq3_frame`) — the stateful access-unit
  decoder: the spec/07 §2 packet walk (slices, zero packets, the end
  marker), the §4 macroblock loop with its byte-boundary end test,
  the per-slice 4×4-block availability / context map (§10.2), the
  I-slice grammar of §6–§9 and the reference picture for the P path;
  `decode_intra_access_unit` remains as the filter-off intra
  convenience. `Svq3Picture::copy_macroblock_from` (zero-motion copy),
  `svq3::parse_extradata_flexible` (bare or `SMI `-wrapped `SEQH`),
  and prediction-taking residual helpers in `svq3_recon`.
- svq3: `tests/svq3_fixture_conformance.rs` — the AU-by-AU scorecard
  against `docs/video/svq3/fixtures/*/expected.yuv` (located through
  `OXIDEAV_SVQ3_FIXTURES` or the umbrella docs checkout; skipped when
  absent). **All three I access units decode byte-exact on every
  plane**: `real-sample-240x128` AU0 (120 macroblocks, 92 intra 4×4 +
  28 intra 16×16 at quantiser 0–1) and `real-sample-320x240-short-seqh`
  AU0 and AU2 — including the leading macroblock that blocked
  r446–r450.
- svq3: `tables/07` (intra 4×4 prediction-mode pairs), `tables/08`
  (the `6 × 6 × 5` neighbour-context resolution) and `tables/09` (the
  intra-picture edge-filter limit) are mirrored bit-exact under
  `tables/svq3-0*.csv` (`tables/MANIFEST-svq3.sha256`) and emitted at
  build time into `svq3_tables`; the wiki-era `INTRA_PRED_PAIRS` /
  `INTRA_PRED_TABLE` constants are gone.
- svq3: `PFrameInterMode::partition_size` / `partition_offsets` — the
  spec/08 §2 partition shapes and coding order of P-slice type codes
  1…7 (16×16, 8×16, 16×8, 8×8, 4×8, 8×4, 4×4).
- svq3: the extended-mode slice-header read sequence of spec/07 §3.3
  (`Svq3ExtendedModeFields`: the `a…e` group after `mode`, the
  `f…h` group plus four `uvlc` values and the trailing bits after the
  extension bytes) is parsed when `mode = 1`; its semantics stay
  unspecified and the macroblock layer of that mode is not decoded.
- svq3: `classify_packet_byte` / `Svq3PacketKind` for the spec/07 §2
  packet byte (`L = (b >> 5) & 3`, `T = b & 0x9f`, bit-7 types
  rejected, the type-0 zero packet), and `parse_wire_slice` now
  returns the unpermuted payload plus the packet's byte length.

### Fixed

- svq3: the slice header carries two reserved bits after the
  optional-data loop, before the macroblock layer starts
  (`Svq3SliceHeader::reserved2`). Pinned by an r450 black-box
  bit-probing campaign against the reference decoder on the staged
  real-stream fixtures: all four values decode byte-identically in I-
  and P-slices alike, while removing the bits desynchronises the
  macroblock layer. `header_end_bit` now points past them, so the
  frame walk starts the macroblock layer two bits later than before.

### Added

- svq3: the intra access-unit frame walk (`svq3_frame`,
  `decode_intra_access_unit`) — slice envelope walk (version-1
  multi-slice continuation at macroblock boundaries, version-2
  macroblock offsets validated against the raster cursor),
  per-macroblock type dispatch, the intra-4×4 grammar (eight
  prediction-mode pair codes with cross-macroblock `pred_table`
  contexts, explicit intra CBP, optional quantiser delta with the new
  ladder-domain check `Error::InvalidQuantiser`, quadrant-ordered
  alternate/normal residual blocks, the fixed intra-luma DC scale),
  the intra-16×16 grammar (separate luma DC block → luma DC secondary
  transform → per-block `169·v_k` scatter via the new
  `svq3_recon::reconstruct_intra_16x16_luma_macroblock_with_dc`,
  scan-start-1 luma AC, implied chroma class), the separate-DC-only
  type, and the per-plane chroma section (DC then AC, scan start 1)
- svq3 registry: `receive_frame` decodes intra access units
  end-to-end into cropped `Yuv420P` frames
  (`Svq3Picture::to_video_frame_cropped`); `make_svq3_decoder`
  accepts the QuickTime `SMI `-wrapped extradata shape by locating
  the `SEQH` marker; P/B slices keep the unsupported error and
  frame-end sentinel packets report `NeedMore`
- svq3: `svq3_mb::decode_intra_4x4_modes_with_context` — the
  generalised intra-4×4 mode decode taking explicit out-of-macroblock
  neighbour contexts so the frame walk threads ACTUAL neighbour modes
  into the wiki `pred_table` lookup

### Changed

- svq3: `reconstruct_intra_macroblock`'s 4×4-intra arm now runs the
  fixed inline intra-luma DC scale
  (`reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs_intra_dc`, the wiki
  `dc = 13·13·1538·block[0]` rule) instead of the general
  coeff·dequant path, matching the frame walk
- svq3: the I-frame macroblock-type wire mapping is re-pinned from
  the staged 320×240 fixture's uniform-black 300-macroblock sync
  frame, whose macroblock layer tiles as 299 identical 14-bit units
  `[type 0][eight pair codes][CBP code 3 → pattern 0]` ending
  bit-exact at the slice boundary: I wire code 0 = intra 4×4
  (dispatch 33; previously the unpinned dispatch-8 slot), wire 1..=24
  = the intra-16×16 records (dispatch +8, unchanged), wire 25 = the
  dispatch-8 "separate luma DC block, no other blocks coded" type
  (`IFrameMbType::SeparateDcOnly`, replacing `Unpinned8`). Validated
  locally against the staged fixtures: with the (still docs-gapped)
  first macroblock skipped — its 48-bit span is pinned by the unit
  tiling — the frame walk decodes the remaining 299 macroblocks of
  the real third-party-encoded sync frame pixel-exact on all three
  planes and consumes the slice to within its 2 padding bits; the
  240×128 fixture's first Cb DC code (1464 → level −185) reproduces
  the expected uniform Cb 70 through the staged chroma pipeline
  exactly. The leading-macroblock element sequence (24 codes where
  the staged grammar spends 2) remains the blocking docs gap

- svq3: the coded-block-pattern element (`svq3_cbp`, spec/03 + tables/01) —
  `cbp_luma` (one bit per 8×8 quadrant, raster order) + `cbp_chroma` (the
  shared 3-valued class), carried as one universal-code code number through
  the 48-entry intra or inter mapping table (decode direction), plus the
  `CodedBlockPattern` split/predicates
- svq3: the intra-16×16 macroblock-type factorisation
  (`svq3_mb::Intra16x16Params`, spec/04 §4.5 + tables/03) —
  `9 + pred_mode + 4·cbp_chroma + 12·luma_ac`, and the standard 16×16
  vertical / horizontal luma predictors alongside plane/DC
  (`svq3_pred::predict_vertical_16x16` / `_horizontal_16x16`,
  `svq3_recon::Svq3Luma16x16Mode::{Vertical, Horizontal}` +
  `from_pred_mode`)
- svq3: the luma DC secondary transform
  (`svq3_dequant::luma_dc_secondary_transform`, spec/04 §4) and the chroma DC
  secondary transform in its authoritative form
  (`chroma_dc_secondary_transform` / `dequantize_chroma_dc_levels`, spec/04
  §2) — the 2×2 Hadamard halved with truncation toward zero — plus the chroma
  quantiser remap (`CHROMA_QUANTISER_INDEX` / `chroma_quantiser_index`,
  spec/04 §3, tables/02). The spec/04 §1 measured basis is pinned by
  single-coefficient response tests

- fuzz: `svq3_intra_frame` target — the whole intra access-unit frame
  walk over arbitrary access-unit bytes at fuzz-derived grid
  geometries (structural canvas invariants asserted on success);
  bounded local runs of it and `registry_stream` are clean against
  the new decode path
- fuzz: eight-target bounded libFuzzer harness (`fuzz/`) — SVQ1 frame-header
  parse, whole-frame intra decode, P/B decode against held references
  (committed 176×144 fixture + synthesised 160×120 overhang geometry), and a
  structured encoder↔decoder differential roundtrip (arbitrary content, all
  dimension residues, every encoder mode + P-frame knob; the decoded P-frame
  must be byte-identical to `Svq1EncodedFrame::reconstruction`); SVQ3 SEQH
  extradata parse, slice envelope (prefix/size/unpermute/header), and the
  macroblock layer (MB-type walk, intra-4×4 mode VLC, all three Golomb
  coefficient walkers, inter-MB motion header, bits→reconstruction with
  hostile-magnitude placed coefficients); and the framework-facing
  `registry_stream` target (`make_decoder` / `make_svq3_decoder` handles over
  arbitrary packetisations, including SVQ3 extradata-at-construction). A
  `fuzz-check` CI job type-checks the harness so it cannot rot; fuzz runs
  themselves stay local and bounded

### Changed

- svq3: every macroblock-layer variable-length element now reads through the
  spec/06 §1 universal code (`svq3::read_universal_code`) instead of the
  earlier exp-Golomb reader — the two agree for code numbers 0…2 (so the
  slice frame-code alphabet is unchanged) but diverge from code 3 up, where
  the universal code interleaves terminator bits among the data bits; the
  signed reader (`svq3_mv::read_signed_code`) folds it per spec/06 §1.1
- svq3: the residual entropy layer is rebuilt from the staged binary-anchored
  tables — the three `(level, run)` code books (tables/05) with their escape
  constructions (tables/06) replace the earlier wiki run-correction arrays,
  and the block decoders (`svq3_coeff::decode_residual_4x4_normal` /
  `_alt` / `decode_chroma_dc_2x2`) place raw levels through the staged scan
  orders, with the spec/06 §5 bounds behaviour (an over-long run is a
  bitstream error)
- svq3: the 4×4 core inverse transform basis third column is corrected to
  `13, −13, −13, 13` (spec/04 §1 measured; the wiki snapshot's `1, −1, −1, 1`
  gave the wrong norm), and the chroma DC path is rebuilt to the spec/04 §2/§3
  authoritative form (chroma-remapped dequant → 2×2 Hadamard halved with
  truncation toward zero → additive `169·B_k`), replacing the wiki-era
  `[[8,8],[8,−8]]` matrix + `(x>>3)>>1` pipeline
- svq3: `IFrameMbType` reworked to the spec/04 §4.5 unified numbering —
  `Intra4x4` / `Intra16x16(Intra16x16Params)` / `Unpinned8` (see the
  known-gaps note below)
- docs: the internal decode/encode/plumbing modules (all `svq1_*` layers and
  the `svq3_*` helpers, plus the low-level SVQ3 parser helpers in `svq3`) are
  now `#[doc(hidden)]` — they remain `pub` for the crate's own tests/fuzz but
  are no longer part of the documented, semver-tracked public API. The stable
  surface (frame-header parser, `BitReader`, `Error`, the registry
  encode/decode entry points, and the SVQ3 `Svq3SequenceHeader` /
  `Svq3SliceHeader` accessor types) is unchanged

### Fixed

- svq3_coeff: the chroma-DC closed-form extension `((code + 9) >> 2) - run`
  is evaluated in 64-bit — a hostile near-`u32::MAX` Golomb code no longer
  wraps on the `+ 9` (found by the `svq3_mb_layer` fuzz target); regression
  test pins the maximum-code path
- svq3_dequant: every dequantization / transform helper computes in 64-bit
  and saturates to the `i32` return domain — hostile wire-reachable
  coefficient magnitudes (the Golomb walkers admit values up to
  `code >> 4` ≈ 2^28) can no longer overflow the dequant-scale multiply, the
  `M·X·Mᵀ` transform dot products, the 2×2 chroma-DC transform, or the fused
  `+ dc + 0x80000 >> 20` finalisation (found by the `svq3_mb_layer` fuzz
  target); conforming-domain results are bit-identical, and the downstream
  `Clip1` writeback bounds the residual regardless

- svq1 tests: genuine-INTER_4MV conformance (`svq1_genuine_4mv_conformance`) —
  the docs #197 `inter-4mv` fixture (byte-identical to `enc_4mv_176x144_4f`)
  supersedes the retracted #161 stream and is the first SVQ1 stream that
  genuinely carries INTER_4MV macroblocks whose decode is confirmed by an
  independent black-box oracle. Pins the exact per-plane T03 census (every
  P-frame's luma grid fully INTER_4MV, the lone non-4MV chroma MB INTRA, 348
  INTER_4MV macroblocks total) in agreement with the fixture's independent wire
  census, plus a truncation + bit-flip robustness sweep over the four-
  differential-read / per-sub-block-clamp 4MV path
- svq1 registry: the genuine-4MV chain decodes end-to-end through
  `make_decoder` / `send_packet` / `receive_frame` — exercises the multi-frame
  decoder state machine and the 4:1:0 → Yuv420P chroma bridge on real 4MV
  output, luma byte-exact against the independent oracle for every frame

### Changed

- svq1: documented the resolved INTER_4MV independent-oracle situation (docs
  #197) in the crate note, README, and mode-census section; scrubbed a
  pre-existing external-implementation family-name from the README encoder note

- svq1 encoder: per-frame rate control — `Svq1EncoderHandle::set_target_frame_bytes`
  finds the smallest λ fitting the byte budget (warm-started doubling +
  bisection; best-effort at the λ ceiling when the budget is unachievable);
  `make_encoder_handle` exposes the concrete handle for the tuning knobs
- svq1 encoder: droppable (B) frame cadence — `Svq1EncoderHandle::set_droppable_period`
  emits `I B P B P …` GOPs; B packets are reference-transparent at the registry
  level (CI-pinned drop test)
- svq1 tests: corrupt-P-frame truncation + bit-flip robustness sweep over the
  reference-window clamp path

- svq1: T03 macroblock coding-mode census — `decode_frame_with_stats` /
  `decode_inter_plane_with_stats` return per-plane SKIP/INTER/INTER_4MV/INTRA
  counts (`Svq1FrameModeStats` / `Svq1PlaneModeStats`); the byte-exact census
  of the docs inter-4mv fixture is CI-pinned and REFUTES the fixture's
  INTER_4MV-presence claim (zero 4MV macroblocks in the entire stream)

- svq1: reference-window MV clamp (`clamp_mv_to_reference_window`) — inter MC
  reads are clamped to the padded reference canvas while the MV cache keeps
  the unclamped vector; arbitrates the spec/06 §6.7/§6.7.4 (#174)

### Added

- **Round 386 — SVQ1 multi-stage codebook search
  (`svq1_enc_leaf::search_leaf`).** The encoder-side inverse of the
  spec/04 §4.5 stage accumulation: per leaf, the rounded residual
  mean (clamped to the intra `[0, 255]` / inter `[-256, +255]`
  domains of spec/05 §5.1) plus a greedy ascending-stage descent
  (spec/04 §4.2 ordering) that commits the SSE-minimising vector of
  each `(level, half, stage)` codebook page while it strictly
  improves, up to the full six stages. The searcher models the
  decoder's wide-accumulation arithmetic exactly, so its
  reconstruction is byte-identical to `reconstruct_leaf` for the
  same wire symbols (asserted across every level × half × budget);
  it also carries exact wire-bit accounting (stage-count VLC + mean
  VLC + `4N` raw index bits) and the inter-only `N = −1` SKIP
  alternative for the coming inter encoder. New intra encoder mode
  `Svq1EncoderMode::MultiStageL3` drives it at L=3; the resulting
  stream was decoded by the reference decoder binary (black-box)
  byte-identical to our own decoder.

- **Round 386 — SVQ1 adaptive block-tree encoder
  (`svq1_enc_tree`).** Per-macroblock λ-cost subdivision over the
  full spec/03 hierarchy: every block at L=5..L=1 either becomes a
  searched multi-stage leaf or splits into its §3.4 child halves
  (squares top/bottom, wider blocks left/right), minimising
  `SSE + λ · bits` with exact wire-bit accounting; L=0 is the
  implicit leaf. Serialisation reproduces the decoder's
  breadth-first per-level queue discipline (spec/03 §3.5.1) so the
  emitted bits decode through the real block-tree walk to the plan's
  own reconstruction (asserted). New frame mode
  `Svq1EncoderMode::Adaptive { lambda }`: `λ = 0` never loses to the
  fixed L=3 tree in SSE; large λ collapses to the mean-only 16×16
  floor. Streams at λ ∈ {0, 32, 2048} (8466 → 860 bytes for the same
  176×144 textured frame) all decoded by the reference decoder
  binary (black-box) byte-identical to our own decoder. Also drops a
  stray debug `eprintln!` from the leaf decoder's error path.

- **Round 386 — SVQ1 P-frame encoder (`svq1_enc_inter`), black-box
  cross-validated including overhang geometry.** Per-macroblock
  SKIP / INTER / INTRA λ-cost mode decision: SKIP copies the
  reference verbatim (one T03 codeword); INTER runs a two-phase
  motion search (full-pel SAD scan around the median predictor +
  ±1 half-pel refinement, spec/06 §6.4/§6.5) and codes the
  differential as two signed T02 codewords (§6.2.3 Reading B), then
  the λ-tree on the inter half (per-leaf SKIP allowed) over the
  motion-compensated baseline; INTRA reuses the intra λ-tree. The
  encoder-side MV cache follows the decoder's §6.8.1 store rules,
  and `encode_inter_frame` returns the decoder-authoritative
  reconstruction for reference chaining. Black-box probing showed
  decoders genuinely diverge on the spec/06 §6.7 out-of-frame
  extension and the spec/04 §4.7.3 overhang-region storage (both
  documented as implementation-defined), so motion candidates are
  confined to a visible-reference window — every VISIBLE output
  sample reads only VISIBLE reference samples, including the second
  half-pel tap. With that constraint, I+3P chains at 176×144 AND at
  the 160×120 overhang geometry decode byte-identical between our
  decoder and the reference decoder binary; leaf-level SKIP and
  mean-only L=4/L=5 inter leaves (both absent from every
  reference-encoder stream we hold) are now positively validated on
  the wire.

- **Round 386 — SVQ1 INTER_4MV encoding (four serial per-8×8 MVs).**
  The encoder now evaluates the fourth macroblock mode: per
  sub-block, the §6.4.4 neighbour predictor is computed against a
  TRIAL MV cache that is updated after each sub-block's search
  (mirroring the decoder's §6.4.5 serial interleave via the new
  `Svq1MvCache::store_subblock`), each 8×8 sub-block gets its own
  two-phase motion search inside its own visible-reference window,
  and the four differentials go on the wire in `SUBBLOCK_ORDER`
  before the inter-half leaf tree over the composite baseline. On
  quadrant-divergent motion the mode cuts P-frames ~5× (1357/1178/
  1076 bytes vs 6744/6112/4985 single-MV) and the whole chain
  decodes byte-identical to the reference decoder binary — the
  first positive wire validation of INTER_4MV in either direction
  (no reference-encoder stream we hold ever emits the mode).

- **Round 386 — INTER_4MV conformance fixture
  (`tests/svq1_enc_inter_conformance.rs`).** Commits the
  quadrant-motion I+3P chain (`enc_4mv_176x144_4f.svq1`, frame sizes
  7601/1357/1178/1076) together with the reference decoder binary's
  own decode of it. CI now pins (1) encoder determinism against the
  committed stream, (2) our decode == the committed reference
  decode, and (3) that the chain genuinely relies on INTER_4MV (a
  `allow_4mv = false` re-encode is >2× larger). Retires the r383
  "INTER_4MV macroblocks decode but have no real-stream fixture"
  tail.

- **Round 386 — registry `Encoder` integration
  (`make_encoder` / `Svq1EncoderHandle`).** The SVQ1 registration
  now carries an encoder factory alongside the decoder: `Yuv420P`
  input frames are nearest-neighbour-decimated back onto the native
  4:1:0 lattice (the exact inverse of the decoder bridge's
  doubling), the first frame and every `keyframe_interval`-th after
  it is coded intra via the λ-tree, and the rest are P-frames
  chained on the decoder-authoritative reconstruction. Packets
  carry the keyframe flag and pass-through PTS; `set_lambda` /
  `set_keyframe_interval` expose the direct-API knobs. Registry
  round-trip (encode through `Encoder`, decode through `Decoder`)
  is CI-pinned.

- **Round 386 — droppable (B) frame encoding.**
  `Svq1InterParams::droppable` emits picture type `2`: the wire
  payload is identical to a P-frame's (SVQ1 B-frames are
  unidirectional, wiki §"Algorithm Basics"), and the frame must
  never enter the reference chain. An I+B+P sequence where the P
  predicts from the I (dropping the B) decodes byte-identical
  between our decoder and the reference decoder binary — positive
  wire validation that conforming decoders keep droppable frames
  out of the reference chain.

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 intra encoder (`svq1_enc`), cross-validated
  against the black-box reference decoder.** Implements the staged
  encoder companion's bring-up ladder
  (`docs/video/svq1/wiki/eggs-naive-svq1-encoder.html`): `BitWriter`
  (the MSB-first mirror of `BitReader`), header emission (common-size
  code or the code-7 explicit escape, all optional trailers off), and
  three modes — `MeanOnlyL5` (one mean-only 16×16 leaf per
  macroblock, the companion's coarsest legal stream), `MeanOnlyL3`
  (four mean-only 8×8 leaves), and `MeanPlusOneStageL3` (per-leaf
  SSE search over the intra L=3 stage-1 codebook vectors in the
  pinned hierarchical tile order, falling back to mean-only). All
  three modes' outputs were decoded by the reference decoder binary
  (black-box, minimal-container delivery) BYTE-IDENTICAL to our own
  decoder's output — the encoder-side counterpart of the decoder
  conformance work. `tests/svq1_encoder_conformance.rs` pins encoder
  determinism against a committed stream plus our-decode ==
  reference-decode on that stream; round-trip unit tests cover all
  modes, overhang dimensions, and the explicit-dimension escape.

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 overhang-dimension conformance + corrupt-stream
  robustness.** A 160×120 I+2P black-box chain fixture
  (`tests/svq1_overhang_conformance.rs`) decodes byte-exact on all
  planes: 160×120 is `frame_size_code = 0` with a non-multiple-of-16
  Y height and 40×30 chroma planes, so the bottom macroblock rows
  overhang the visible frame — pinning spec/02 §2.8 item 1 as
  **decode-and-discard** (full 16×16 macroblocks are coded over the
  overhang; the visible crop matches the reference). A companion
  robustness test sweeps truncations of a conformant frame at every
  byte boundary, a deterministic pseudo-random byte soup, and a
  bit-flip sweep over the frame head — every case errors cleanly
  (no panics, no loops).

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 `receive_frame` — the registry decoder returns
  real pixels.** `Svq1DecoderHandle::receive_frame` now runs the full
  `svq1_plane::decode_frame` pipeline against the handle's held
  reference picture and returns an `oxideav_core::VideoFrame`. I- and
  P-frames become the reference for the next frame; B ("droppable")
  frames never do (wiki §"Algorithm Basics"); `reset` drops the
  reference. Output is `Yuv420P` via the new
  `Svq1DecodedFrame::to_video_frame_420` bridge — SVQ1's native
  YUV 4:1:0 chroma is nearest-neighbour-doubled onto the 4:2:0 grid
  because the framework `PixelFormat` enum carries no 4:1:0 layout
  yet (follow-up: add `Yuv410P` to `oxideav-core` and emit native
  planes; the unresampled 4:1:0 planes remain reachable through the
  standalone `svq1_plane` API). The round-2 "pixel decode blocked on
  codebook docs-gap" `Unsupported` sentinel is gone; three registry
  tests cover the I-frame end-to-end path, the P-after-I
  held-reference path (including reset dropping the reference), and
  truncated-plane-data rejection.

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 P-frame (inter) decode, byte-exact across a
  six-frame chain.** `svq1_plane` grows the interframe path:
  `read_mb_mode` (T03), `read_mv_component` / `read_mv_differential`
  (T02), `decode_inter_plane` (per-MB mode dispatch → SKIP copy /
  INTER single-MV / INTER_4MV four-MV / INTRA, the spec/06 median MV
  predictor + `[-32, +31]` clip + per-plane MV cache, half-pel MC
  baseline via `svq1_mc`, then the breadth-first leaf walk on the
  inter tables), and `decode_frame` (I / P / B dispatch against an
  optional reference; new `Error::MissingReference`).
  `tests/svq1_inter_conformance.rs` decodes a reference-encoder-
  produced P-frame byte-exact on all three planes against the
  encoder binary's own decode, plus a six-frame I+5P chain fixture
  (SKIP + INTER + INTRA mode mix) where every frame predicts from
  OUR previous reconstruction and lands byte-exact. Two more wire
  facts pinned in the Validator role (docs errata):
  1. **spec/06 §6.2.3 Reading B** — the MV component is ONE signed
     T02 codeword (`position − 32`); no separate sign bit, no
     distinct peek-bit step (T02's position-32 codeword IS the
     single `1` bit the wiki's peek-bit describes).
  2. **audit/01 §7.1 T03 permutation** — the mode alphabet is
     ROTATED against the wiki numbering: position 3 = SKIP (the
     1-bit codeword), 0 = INTER, 1 = INTER_4MV, 2 = INTRA
     (`wiki_mode = (position + 1) mod 4`). SKIP / INTER / INTRA are
     pinned byte-exact; INTER_4MV holds the remaining position by
     elimination (the black-box encoder never emits it — flagged
     as a follow-up for a 4MV-bearing sample).
  Also pinned byte-exact along the way: the §6.5.1 half-pel
  `(a + b + 1) >> 1` rounding, §6.7.2 edge replication, the §6.4
  neighbour geometry, and x-before-y component order.

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 whole-frame intra decode (`svq1_plane`),
  BYTE-EXACT against a black-box reference decode.** The new
  `svq1_plane` module composes every staged layer into the real wire
  decode: per-plane 16×16 MB raster scan (spec/02 §2.3/§2.4), the
  breadth-first L=5→L=0 block-tree walk with the §3.4
  dimension-halving geometry (`Svq1PlaneCanvas` MB-padded canvases,
  overhang decode-and-crop per §4.7.3), per-leaf stage-count /
  mean / stage-index reads, codebook stage accumulation, and the
  full-frame `decode_intra_frame` (header + Y + U + V at the 4:1:0
  chroma geometry). `tests/svq1_intra_conformance.rs` decodes a
  reference-encoder-produced 176×144 I-frame **byte-exact on all
  three planes** (28 512/28 512 samples) against the encoder
  binary's own decode — the Validator round the docs called for.
  Four wire-format facts were pinned (all docs errata):
  1. **§14.8 codebook layout resolved** — the canonical 23 040-byte
     region (functional base `0x5d214`, audit/00 §2.3; upper bound
     `0x62c14`) tiles level-major DESCENDING (L=3→L=0), intra half
     then inter half per level — neither §14.8 hypothesis. The
     first 16 canonical bytes are the block-shape-LUT dual-use
     window; the last 20 (`0x62c00..0x62c14`, past the staged
     `codebook-l0l3.csv` extraction) are staged locally as
     `tables/codebook-tail.csv` (extracted at the audit-pinned
     offsets from the SHA-pinned staged binary) — closing the
     audit/00 §7 item-1 "16-byte gap".
  2. **L=2 / L=3 vector byte→sample order is hierarchical**
     (`vector_byte_to_raster`): 16-byte 4×4 raster tiles in
     subdivision order (L=3: TL, TR, BL, BR; L=2: L, R), not
     whole-block raster (§4.7.1 erratum).
  3. **Wide accumulation, single final clamp** (spec/04 §4.11
     item 2 resolved): per-stage clamping loses transient
     overshoots the reference decode preserves; `reconstruct_leaf`
     now accumulates wide and saturates once at the store.
  4. **The L=4 / L=5 subdivide bit can legitimately read `0`** —
     the wiki gate is `(stages > 0) && (level >= 4)` on the STAGE
     COUNT (spec/03 §3.8.2); real streams carry mean-only 16×16
     leaves for flat regions. `read_block_decision` now accepts
     the leaf decision at every level and the leaf decoder fires
     `InvalidLevelQuantise` only on `N ≥ 1` at L≥4 (mean-only
     L=4/L=5 leaves fill with `saturate(pred + mean)`).
  New errors: `UnexpectedIntraSkip` (SKIP on an intra leaf, §4.9.1
  conformant rejection), `ReconstructFailed`. New codebook surface:
  `codebook_canonical()` / `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_CANONICAL_BYTES` /
  `half_byte_offset_in_payload` / `codebook_half` /
  `vector_byte_to_raster`.

- **Round 383 — SVQ1 wire VLC layer (`svq1_vlc`) — all sixteen staged
  tables landed.** Mirrors the sixteen VLC tables the docs
  collaborator's Extractor 03 pass staged
  (`docs/video/svq1/tables/vlc_*.csv`, round 6) and Auditor 02
  role-mapped (`docs/video/svq1/audit/01-report.md`, round 7)
  bit-exact into `tables/` and parses them at build time into
  compile-time constants: the single inter mean VLC (T00, alphabet
  512, `min_value = −256`), the single intra mean VLC (T01, alphabet
  256), the motion-vector component VLC (T02, alphabet 64), the
  interframe MB-coding-mode VLC (T03, alphabet 4), and the twelve
  per-`(level, half)` stage-count VLCs (T04..T15, L=5..L=0 × intra /
  inter). The new `svq1_vlc` module builds a verified prefix-code
  decoder per table (`Svq1VlcDecoder`): record index = alphabet
  position, record value = the codeword's MSB-first bit pattern —
  the constructor PROVES the reading by rejecting any duplicate /
  prefix-colliding table, and all sixteen pass with the documented
  Kraft sums (fifteen complete; T02 at the audit's `8187/8192`).
  Role-layer reads land as `read_stage_count` (`N = position − 1`,
  spec/04 §4.1 audit-corrected: −1 SKIP / 0 mean-only / 1..6
  stages), `read_intra_mean` (`u8`), `read_inter_mean` (`s9`),
  `read_mv_component_position` and `read_mb_mode_position` (raw
  positions — the Reading A/B and mode-permutation open items stay
  with the plane layer). New `Error::InvalidVlcCode` surfaces the
  no-codeword-matched case (T02's five soft-reserved length-13
  patterns). 13 new lib tests pin the audit's evidence lines
  (inter-mean 0 → 1-bit code, intra-mean 25/26 → 4-bit, T02 symmetry
  around position 32, T03 lengths {2,3,3,1}, intra/inter peak
  positions, duplicate sets A/B) plus an exhaustive every-codeword
  decode round-trip across representative tables.

- **Round 374 — SVQ1 L=3 inter sub-block reconstruction (`svq1_mc`).**
  Composes the §6.5.2 motion-compensation patch into the §4.6.2 inter
  predictor role of `reconstruct_leaf`: the first end-to-end *reference
  plane + MV → reconstructed inter sub-block* path.
  `reconstruct_inter_l3_block(plane, base_col, base_row, mv, inter_half,
  mean, stages)` motion-compensates the 8×8 (`L=3`) reference patch,
  then runs the multistage-VQ leaf accumulation (inter mean step +
  ascending codebook stages, each saturated to `[0, 255]`) with that
  patch as the per-position predictor — the inter counterpart of the
  zero-predictor intra leaf. The block is always `L=3` (64 samples), so
  the MC patch is exactly the predictor length the leaf reconstruction
  requires; smaller leaf sizes need the block-tree subdivision geometry
  (deferred). 6 new lib tests: mean-only = MC + mean, zero-mean = MC
  patch verbatim, negative-mean saturation to 0, single-stage codebook
  addition, and propagation of codebook-lookup / stage-overflow errors.

- **Round 374 — SVQ1 half-pel motion-compensation reference sampling
  (`svq1_mc`).** New `svq1_mc` module implementing
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/06-motion-vectors.md` §6.5 (the half-pel
  sampling grid + `(a + b + 1) >> 1` interpolator) and §6.7 (de-facto
  edge-replication border extension). `Svq1ReferencePlane<'a>` is a
  borrowed row-major plane view with `sample_clamped` (§6.7.2 clamp).
  `sample_halfpel(plane, half_x, half_y)` splits each signed half-pel
  coordinate into an integer-pel floor + parity bit and selects the
  §6.5.1 case: integer-pel direct (both even), horizontal two-tap
  (x odd), vertical two-tap (y odd), or bilinear four-tap (both odd),
  each with the round-toward-+∞ bias (`+1` / `+2`).
  `motion_compensate_block(plane, base_col, base_row, mv)` reconstructs
  the 8×8 (`MC_BLOCK_DIM`) reference patch of §6.5.2: top-left half-pel
  address `(base_col*2 + mv.x, base_row*2 + mv.y)`, each output step
  advancing the half-pel address by 2 (one integer pel), row-major
  output. Reuses the existing `Svq1Mv`. The §6.5.1/§6.7.2 conventions
  are the spec's documented de-facto baseline (binary confirmation
  deferred to a Validator round); the T02 differential MV decode that
  produces the vector remains the separately-deferred §6.2.3 Reading
  A/B gap. 14 new lib tests: plane validation / clamping, the four
  parity cases against their closed forms, negative-coordinate phase
  flooring, uniform-plane flatness, and block MC for zero / integer /
  uniform / out-of-frame / per-step-addressing cases.

- **Round 374 — SVQ3 full-pel inter block predictor (`svq3_mc`).** The
  first end-to-end *motion vector → predicted block* path: ties the
  sixths-grid split into the reference fetch. New `Svq3MotionVector { dx,
  dy }` (stored-sixths components) and `predict_inter_block_fullpel`,
  which decomposes each component via `split_mv_component` and, when
  both land on the integer grid (`frac_sixths == 0`), returns the
  clamped `fetch_fullpel_block` copy at the MV-shifted origin. When
  either component carries a sub-pel remainder it returns `None` rather
  than guessing the per-fractional-phase filter selection the wiki does
  not pin (deferred DOCS-GAP). 6 new lib tests: zero-MV collocated copy,
  integer-MV origin shift, sub-pel-x / sub-pel-y / negative-remainder
  `None` cases, and out-of-frame edge-replication.

- **Round 374 — SVQ3 whole-block thirdpel interpolation (`svq3_mc`).**
  Composes the pinned per-sample thirdpel formulas across a whole
  motion-compensation block. `interpolate_block_thirdpel_h` /
  `interpolate_block_thirdpel_v` apply the wiki's 1-D
  `((2·A + B + 1)·0x2AB) >> 11` with the farther sample one full pel to
  the right / below each position; `interpolate_block_thirdpel_2d`
  applies the 2-D `((4·A + 3·B + 3·C + 2·D + 6)·0xAAB) >> 15` over the
  2×2 integer-pel neighbourhood in `THIRDPEL_2D_WEIGHTS` order. All
  three fetch neighbours through `ReferencePlane::sample_clamped`
  (H.264 edge replication) and `Clip1`-saturate to `0..=255`
  (`docs/video/svq3/spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 5), with
  row-major output matching the reconstruction loops. The caller
  positions the origin so `A` is the nearer integer sample (via
  `split_mv_component`); the wiki does not pin the per-fractional-phase
  filter selection, so these cover the forward-neighbour 1-D/2-D cases
  the formulas spell out. 9 new lib tests: uniform-plane identity for
  all three filters, per-sample-formula agreement (H / V / 2-D), byte-
  range output, the right-border edge-clamp reducing the 1-D filter to
  `interp(A, A)`, and `Clip1` saturation.

- **Round 374 — SVQ3 motion-vector sixths-grid decomposition
  (`svq3_mc`).** Splits a stored motion-vector component into the
  integer-pel displacement (the `fetch_fullpel_block` window origin
  offset) and the sub-pel remainder (the interpolation filter input).
  Per `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Motion
  Compensation" — *"motion vectors are stored and predicted as fraction
  of six"* — the storage grid is sixths-of-a-sample. New
  `MV_FRACTION_BASE = 6`, `MvComponentSplit { integer_pel, frac_sixths }`,
  and `split_mv_component(stored_sixths)` computing
  `integer_pel = ⌊v/6⌋` (Euclidean floor toward −∞) and
  `frac_sixths = v mod 6 ∈ 0..6` (always non-negative), so a negative
  component keeps the same sub-pel phase as its positive counterpart and
  `integer_pel·6 + frac_sixths == v` reconstructs for every signed
  input. 7 new lib tests: the base constant, the zero / exact-full-pel /
  positive-fraction / negative-floor cases, the reconstruction identity
  swept over `[-100, 100]`, and `const` evaluability.

- **Round 374 — SVQ3 reference-plane integer-pel block fetch
  (`svq3_mc`).** Lands the full-pel motion-compensation reference copy
  the sub-pel thirdpel filters refine. New `ReferencePlane<'a>` — a
  borrowed row-major picture-plane view (`width × height` u8 samples)
  with `sample_clamped(x, y)` performing H.264 edge-replication
  clamping for unrestricted motion vectors (each signed coordinate
  clamped to `[0, w-1]` / `[0, h-1]` before the lookup), validated at
  construction (`new` rejects length mismatch / zero dimension). New
  `fetch_fullpel_block(plane, origin_x, origin_y, block_w, block_h)`
  copies a `block_w × block_h` integer-pel window (row-major output
  matching the reconstruction loops) with every out-of-bounds sample
  resolved by edge replication — the macroblock predictor when a motion
  vector lands exactly on the integer grid, and the pre-filter window
  otherwise. The sub-pel filter-application stage + the sixths-grid
  precision rounding remain deferred DOCS-GAPs (the wiki pins neither
  the rounding direction nor the per-fractional-position 1-D/2-D filter
  selection). 11 new lib tests: construction validation, the row-major
  in-bounds lookup, negative / beyond-extent clamping, interior-window
  copy, top-left / bottom-right corner replication, partial-overlap
  straddle, and a full 16×16 fetch.

- **Round 365 — SVQ3 macroblock-grid geometry + per-MB neighbour
  availability (`svq3`).** The pure-geometry prerequisite the slice-level
  intra-frame walk needs to drive the per-macroblock units, independent
  of the (still-gated) CBP wire decode. New surface:
  - `mb_grid_dims(seqh) -> (mb_cols, mb_rows)` — the 16×16-macroblock
    tiling dimensions (right/bottom edges rounded up);
    `mb_cols * mb_rows == num_macroblocks(seqh)` (now implemented in
    terms of this helper).
  - `Svq3MacroblockPosition { mb_x, mb_y, top_available, left_available }`
    with `luma_origin()` → `(mb_x*16, mb_y*16)`, and
    `macroblock_position(mb_index, mb_cols)` deriving the raster column /
    row and the intra-prediction above/left neighbour availability
    (`mb_y > 0` / `mb_x > 0`) — the `top_avail` / `left_avail` inputs
    `decode_intra_4x4_modes` / `decode_and_reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock`
    consume. Rejects `mb_cols == 0`.
  - 4 new lib tests: grid-dims vs `num_macroblocks` agreement, the
    raster + availability mapping for the corner / top-row / left-column /
    interior cases with pixel-origin checks, and the zero-cols guard.

- **Round 365 — SVQ3 intra-luma DC scale residual path (`svq3_dequant`
  / `svq3_recon`).** Wires the SVQ3-specific intra-luma DC handling the
  wiki §"Macroblock transform and dequantization" pins — "For intra
  luma blocks without separate DC coefficients block:
  `dc = 13 * 13 * 1538 * block[0]`" — which the existing
  `reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs` did not apply (it ran
  `block[0]` through the general `coeff · svq3_dequant_coeff[Q]` AC
  scale). New surface:
  - `dequantize_transform_intra_luma_block(q, block)` computes the DC
    override `dc = INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE · block[0]`, zeroes the inline DC
    coefficient so it does not also contribute through the AC dequant,
    then runs `dequantize_transform_luma_block_with_dc` with that `dc`
    (the post-transform additive term per the wiki formula).
  - `reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs_intra_dc` — the
    intra-DC counterpart to the general from-coeffs luma recon, using
    the new per-block dequant for each of the 16 sub-blocks. This is the
    correct residual path for a 4×4-intra MB (types `1..=24`) whose luma
    DCs are carried inline. The separate-DC-block branch (MB types `0` /
    `25`, "luma DCs coded in a separate 4×4 block") needs the separate
    luma-DC block transform + distribution, which is **not pinned** under
    `docs/video/svq3/` and remains a deferred DOCS-GAP.
  - 7 new lib tests: the intra-DC dequant lifts a DC-only block
    uniformly, differs from the general AC path when DC is present,
    reduces to the general path when DC is zero, and is `const`-
    evaluable; the recon variant differs from / matches the general
    recon for DC-present / DC-absent inputs and produces a flat-128
    plane for zero coefficients.

- **Round 365 — SVQ3 bitstream-driven intra-4×4 luma macroblock
  reconstruction (`svq3_recon`).** Ties the round-365 intra-mode VLC
  decode into the existing reconstruction loop, producing the first
  end-to-end *bitstream → reconstructed 16×16 luma plane* path for a
  4×4-intra macroblock. New surface:
  - `intra_modes_from_grid(grid) -> [Svq3IntraMode; 16]` converts the
    `Intra4x4ModeGrid` of block-index-ordered `u8` modes into the
    `Svq3IntraMode` array the reconstruction loops consume (via
    `Svq3IntraMode::from_value`, infallible for the validated `0..=4`
    grid values).
  - `decode_and_reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock(br, mb, coeff_blocks,
    q, top_avail, left_avail) -> Intra4x4ModeGrid` reads the 16 modes
    from the slice bits (`decode_intra_4x4_modes`), converts them, then
    runs `reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs` (spec/01 Gap 2
    residual interleave + Gap 3/4 predictors + Gap 5 writeback). The
    decoded grid is returned so the caller can thread the per-block
    modes into neighbouring macroblocks' intra prediction.
  - 4 new lib tests: grid→mode conversion round-trip, flat-128 DC
    reconstruction from the all-code-0 / zero-coefficient stream, exact
    agreement of the fused entry with the separate decode-then-
    reconstruct path over a non-trivial coefficient block, and
    truncation propagation. This entry point still takes the placed
    coefficient grids as an argument (the CBP-driven residual presence
    is the remaining DOCS-GAP); the slice-level frame walk that calls
    it per macroblock is gated on the same CBP `me(v)` trace.

- **Round 365 — SVQ3 intra-4×4 prediction-mode VLC wire decode +
  per-macroblock mode-decode driver (`svq3_mb`).** Closes the
  intra-4×4 prediction-mode VLC gap the README named as a lacks-tail
  blocker. The wiki §"Intra macroblock information decoding" lists the
  25 intra-mode pairs in a single contiguous `0..=24` enumeration and
  §"Decoding Process" states the codec "extensively uses Golomb
  coding" — so the selecting VLC is the unsigned exp-Golomb `ue(v)`
  code whose code-number indexes `INTRA_PRED_PAIRS` directly (the same
  Golomb-indexed-listing convention `read_mb_type` already uses). New
  surface:
  - `read_intra_4x4_pred_pair(br) -> (u8, u8)` reads one `ue(v)`
    codeword and resolves it to the `(idx_a, idx_b)` table-index pair,
    rejecting out-of-alphabet codes (`>= 25`) with `InvalidFrameCode`
    and propagating `Truncated`.
  - `INTRA_4X4_PRED_BLOCK_PAIRS: [(u8, u8); 8]` — the eight
    `(first_block, second_block)` 4×4 sub-block index pairs that share
    one codeword, taken row-major from the wiki picture
    (`(0,1) (4,5) (2,3) (6,7) (8,9) (12,13) (10,11) (14,15)`); the
    paired view of `INTRA_4X4_SCAN_ORDER`.
  - `decode_intra_4x4_modes(br, top_avail, left_avail) ->
    Intra4x4ModeGrid` — the per-macroblock driver: for each of the
    eight pairs it reads one codeword, then resolves each of the two
    blocks' mode via `resolve_intra_4x4_predictor` against that
    block's own already-decoded top / left neighbour modes (in-MB 4×4
    neighbours as `Mode4x4`, out-of-MB edges as `Intra16x16OrInter`
    when the neighbour MB exists else `Outside` per the wiki's "-1
    when outside slice" rule). The strictly-serial scan order
    guarantees a block's in-MB neighbours are decoded first; block `b`
    of a pair sees block `a`'s freshly-decoded mode. `Intra4x4ModeGrid`
    carries the 16 resolved modes in raster block-index order with
    `mode(index)` / `modes()` accessors — the per-block intra-mode
    sequence feeding the `svq3_recon` predictors.
  - `INTRA_PRED_PAIRS_LEN = 25` alphabet-size constant.
  - 13 new lib tests: the pair table is a permutation of `0..16` and
    matches the scan-order grouping; the VLC reader indexes all 25
    pairs, rejects code 25, handles truncation, and consumes exact
    bits across back-to-back codes; the per-MB driver succeeds on the
    all-code-0 stream with/without neighbour MBs, threads in-MB
    neighbour modes (block 1 sees block 0 as its left neighbour, block
    4 sees block 0 as its top), propagates the `-1` `pred_table`
    sentinel as `InvalidIntraPrediction`, and propagates mid-stream
    truncation; plus `Intra4x4ModeGrid` accessor coverage. The CBP
    `me(v)` coded-block-pattern table remains a DOCS-GAP (the wiki
    defers it wholesale to H.264 and the H.264 `me(v)` mapping is not
    reproduced under `docs/video/svq3/`), so the slice-level frame
    walk above these per-MB units stays gated on that one trace.

- **Round 356 — SVQ3 whole intra-macroblock reconstruction composition
  (`svq3_recon`).** Ties the three per-plane reconstruction paths into
  the per-macroblock assembly unit a frame walk emits. New
  `Svq3IntraMacroblock` carrier (one `LumaMacroblock` + two
  `ChromaPlane`s, Cb/Cr), `Svq3LumaIntra` enum (`Blocks4x4` / `Whole16x16`
  selecting the 4×4-intra mode loop or the 16×16-intra whole-MB loop),
  `ChromaPlaneCoeffs` (2×2 DC block + four AC grids), and
  `reconstruct_intra_macroblock` which dispatches the luma regime and
  reconstructs both chroma planes at the shared slice quantiser. 3 unit
  tests cover the all-DC flat-128 macroblock, dispatcher↔standalone
  16×16 luma equivalence, and Cb/Cr plane independence. The slice-level
  frame walk driving these per-MB units (and the CBP / intra-mode VLC
  decode feeding them) remains a deferred docs gap.

- **Round 356 — SVQ3 intra chroma 8×8 plane reconstruction
  (`svq3_recon`).** Lands the chroma-plane reconstruction path,
  composing the staged
  `docs/video/svq3/spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 4
  (chroma DC-only prediction), Gap 2 (separate 2×2 chroma DC block +
  chroma AC residual interleave), and Gap 5 (saturating writeback). New
  `ChromaPlane` carrier (8×8 samples + 8-sample above/left neighbours +
  availability) and `reconstruct_intra_chroma_plane_from_coeffs`: the
  whole 8×8 plane is DC-predicted (`predict_chroma_dc_8x8`, no plane /
  vertical / horizontal chroma mode in SVQ3); the separate 2×2 chroma DC
  block is `[[8,8],[8,−8]]` Hadamard-transformed then chroma-dequant'd
  `(svq3_dequant_coeff[Q]·(block[0]>>3))>>1` into four **pre-finalisation**
  DC terms (one per chroma 4×4 quadrant, row-major 2×2 index → quadrant);
  each quadrant's chroma AC grid is then dequant·scaled → two-sided
  `M·X·Mᵀ` → fused `+ dc + 0x80000 >>20` with that quadrant's DC as the
  override, so the single `>>20` finalisation applies exactly once. 6
  unit tests cover flat-128 DC, the both-neighbours average, the 2×2 DC
  index→quadrant raster mapping, and AC residual composition.

- **Round 356 — SVQ3 intra-16×16 luma macroblock reconstruction
  (`svq3_recon`).** Lands the second whole-macroblock intra
  reconstruction path beside the existing 4×4-intra loop, composing the
  staged `docs/video/svq3/spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 4
  (16×16 predictors) + Gap 2 (residual interleave) + Gap 5 (saturating
  writeback). New `Svq3Luma16x16Mode` enum (`Plane` / `Dc`) selects the
  SVQ3 transposed-plane predictor (`predict_plane_16x16`) or the H.264
  16×16 DC predictor (`predict_dc_16x16`) for the **whole** macroblock —
  unlike the 4×4 path there is no per-sub-block intra-mode sequencing.
  `reconstruct_intra_16x16_luma_macroblock_from_coeffs` builds the single
  16×16 prediction plane, then adds each of the 16 luma 4×4 sub-blocks'
  residual (Gap 2 dequant·scale → two-sided `M·X·Mᵀ` → fused
  `+0x80000 >>20`) in raster order with the Gap 5 `Clip1(pred+residual)`
  writeback. 5 unit tests cover flat-128 DC, both the DC and plane
  predictor over flat neighbours, and the raster index→pixel-origin
  residual mapping.

- **Round 353 — SVQ3 signed-Golomb entropy layer: motion-vector
  difference + quantiser-delta wire decode (`svq3_mv`).** Lands the
  signed variable-length codes the wiki §"Inter macroblock information
  decoding" names but the structural scaffold left unread. New
  `svq3_mv` module: `read_se_golomb` (signed Exp-Golomb `se(v)`,
  layered on the existing unsigned `read_ue_golomb`, folding code_num
  `k` onto the signed line `0→0, 1→+1, 2→−1, …`); `read_mv_difference`
  reading the **Y component first** then X per the wiki, into a typed
  `MotionVectorDifference`; `read_mb_mv_differences` pulling the exact
  per-partition count from `Svq3MbType::num_motion_vectors` (0 for
  SKIP / intra / B-direct, 1/2/4/8/16 for the P inter modes, 2 for
  B-bidirectional) in raster order; and `read_quantiser_delta` for the
  optional pre-coefficient signed quant delta. 17 unit tests cover the
  `se(v)` folding table, signed round-trips, Y-then-X order, exact bit
  consumption, per-mode MV counts, and truncation propagation. The
  CBP field the wiki flags as "coded the same way as in H.264" remains
  a DOCS-GAP: its codeword↔value mapping is the H.264 `me(v)` table,
  not reproduced under `docs/video/svq3/`.

- **Round 353 — SVQ3 inter-macroblock motion-header composition
  (`svq3_mv`).** Adds `Svq3InterMacroblockHeader` + the
  `read_inter_macroblock_header` entry point composing the two staged
  inter-MB wire fields in the wiki's documented order: the frame-type
  aware precision selector (`svq3_mb::read_inter_mv_precision`, which
  consumes a bit on P-frames and is implicit halfpel on B-frames) then
  the per-partition MV-difference list. 6 further tests cover P-frame
  fullpel/halfpel precision-bit consumption ordering, B-frame implicit
  halfpel, the 8×8 four-MV case, SKIP (precision-only) parsing, and
  mid-field truncation. This is the first end-to-end composition of the
  SVQ3 inter-MB header from raw slice bits toward P-frame decode; the
  CBP read + absolute-MV predictor reconstruction remain the open
  gaps.

- **Round 339 — SVQ3 macroblock-level intra predictor-selection loop
  (`svq3_recon`).** Assembles the leaf primitives into the
  macroblock-level reconstruction loop the README named as the open
  lacks-tail. `reconstruct_intra_luma_macroblock` walks the 16 luma
  4×4 sub-blocks of a `LumaMacroblock` carrier in the wiki's documented
  processing order (`svq3_mb::INTRA_4X4_SCAN_ORDER`, with the spatial
  layout in the new `LUMA_BLOCK_GRID_POS` index→cell map derived from
  the same wiki picture), assembles each sub-block's neighbours
  (top row + left column + corner, with macroblock-edge availability)
  from the running reconstructed plane — including the out-of-MB
  `above` / `leftcol` neighbour rows the carrier holds — selects +
  applies the predictor via `predict_intra_4x4`, and composes the
  caller-supplied residual block via Gap 5's `Clip1(pred + residual)`
  writeback. The loop is residual-provider-driven: the residual
  pipeline (dequant · `M·X·Mᵀ` · fused `>>20`, spec/01 Gap 2) stays a
  deferred docs-gap because Gap 2 does not pin the exact
  dequant-multiply / transform interleave as a per-element formula. 11
  new unit tests cover the grid-position inversion, neighbour assembly
  for interior / top-left / edge sub-blocks, the scan-order dependency
  sequencing, and end-to-end flat-DC / vertical / horizontal /
  residual-add macroblock reconstruction.

- **Round 339 — SVQ3 16×16 plane (transposed) + 8×8 chroma DC
  predictors (spec/01 Gap 4).** Lands the two H.264-back-referenced
  predictors whose decode-side sample equations
  `docs/video/svq3/spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 4 now
  pins. `predict_plane_16x16` implements the standard H.264 16×16
  plane fit (`H`/`V`/`a`/`b`/`c` from `top[]`/`left[]`, constants
  `5`/`32`/`>>6`/`16`/`>>5`) with SVQ3's documented **transpose**
  (`b` applied along `y`, `c` along `x`) and the 8-bit `Clip1`
  writeback. `predict_chroma_dc_8x8` implements Gap 4's chroma "DC
  mode only" rule with the per-4×4-quadrant availability-driven
  averaging (`(Σtop+Σleft+4)>>3` / `(Σ+2)>>2` / `128`). The companion
  `predict_dc_16x16` 16×16 DC predictor covers the macroblock-edge
  fallback where the plane predictor's neighbours are not both
  available. `PRED_16X16_DIM`/`_SAMPLES` and
  `PRED_CHROMA_DIM`/`_SAMPLES` surface the block geometries. 10 new
  unit tests cover uniform-neighbour reproduction, the transpose
  axis-assignment, the DC availability cases, and per-quadrant chroma
  DC independence.

- **Round 339 — SVQ3 4×4 intra-mode binding + the standard-H.264
  predictors.** Lands the four 4×4 intra predictors `docs/video/svq3/
  spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 3 names as "standard
  H.264 … unmodified" — `predict_vertical_4x4` (mode 0),
  `predict_horizontal_4x4` (mode 1), `predict_dc_4x4` (mode 2, with
  the availability-driven `(Σtop+Σleft+4)>>3` / `(Σ+2)>>2` / `128`
  averaging set), and `predict_diagonal_down_right_4x4` (mode 4, the
  3-tap `(a+2b+c+2)>>2` main-diagonal filter reading the above-left
  `corner`). The mode-to-predictor binding the README named as a
  lacks-tail item lands as the `Svq3IntraMode` enum (Gap 3's
  `0=Vertical / 1=Horizontal / 2=DC / 3=DiagonalDownLeft /
  4=DiagonalDownRight`, with `Svq3IntraMode::DEFAULT = Dc` per Gap 3's
  "default/fallback predictor is value 2") plus the
  `predict_intra_4x4` dispatcher, which routes a resolved mode to its
  predictor over an `Intra4x4Neighbours` carrier (top row + left
  column + corner + availability flags) and applies the standard
  H.264 DC fallback when a directional predictor's neighbour is
  unavailable. Mode 3 keeps the existing SVQ3 diagonal-down quirk
  (`predict_diagonal_down_4x4`). All predictors are `const fn`. 19 new
  unit tests cover the value↔mode round-trip, each predictor's
  closed form, the DC availability cases, and the dispatcher's routing
  + DC fallback.

- **Round 331 — SVQ3 4×4 scan-order arrays + selection rule.** Lands
  the two 16-entry 4×4 coefficient scan tables that round 233 had
  deferred for lack of a pinned source: `NORMAL_ZIGZAG_4X4_SCAN`
  (`0, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 10, 7, 11, 14, 15`) and
  `ALT_SCAN_4X4_SCAN`
  (`0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15`),
  transcribed bit-exact from
  `docs/video/svq3/spec/01-reconstruction-composition.md` Gap 1 (the
  Sorenson Video QuickTime Component `.data` tables at file offsets
  `0x7e5a8` / `0x7e5b8`). Adds the quantiser-driven selection helper
  `select_4x4_scan` (alt-scan only for a luma 4×4-intra block at
  slice quantiser `< 24`, threshold `ALT_SCAN_QUANTISER_THRESHOLD`),
  the `ALT_SCAN_4X4_HALF_LEN = 8` two-half marker (wiki §"Macroblock
  layer" cross-check), and the `place_4x4_normal_zigzag` /
  `place_4x4_alt_scan` / `place_4x4` convenience wrappers over the
  existing generic `place_coefficients_in_scan_order`. 11 new unit
  tests assert the bit-exact byte values, full-permutation /
  DC-first invariants, the two-half split, the selection boundary at
  `Q == 24`, and the placement routing.

- **Round 326 — SVQ1 motion-vector cache + neighbour-selection
  geometry.** New `svq1_mv_cache` module landing the per-plane MV cache
  of `docs/video/svq1/spec/06-motion-vectors.md` §6.8 and the
  neighbour-selection geometry of §6.4.3 (INTER, single MV) / §6.4.4
  (INTER_4MV, per-sub-block), the caller-side counterpart of the §6.4
  median predictor (which takes the three candidate neighbours but
  leaves their selection + storage to the caller). `Svq1MvCache` is a
  `(mb_cols × 2) × (mb_rows × 2)` grid of 8×8-block MVs (the §6.1.1
  granularity invariant), initialised to `(0, 0)` (§6.8.1) with a
  single-frame lifetime (§6.8.2). `inter_neighbours` selects
  `{pl=(r,c−1), pt=(r−2,c), ptr=(r−2,c+2)}` reproducing the wiki grid
  `[1 2 / 3 4]` → `{N, C, E}`; `inter_4mv_neighbours` selects the four
  per-sub-block triples of the §6.4.4 table (including the §6.4.4 note
  that sub-blocks 3/4 use within-MB top-left vectors as `ptr`).
  `decode_inter` / `decode_inter_4mv` compose the predictor + §6.6 clip
  + §6.8.1 cache update; the INTER_4MV path is strictly serial (§6.4.5,
  sub-block N reads sub-blocks `< N`). `store_inter` broadcasts to all
  four slots, `store_skip_intra` applies the §6.9 `(0,0)` reset. Out-of-
  bounds `get` is an **absent** neighbour (§6.4.2), distinct from an
  in-bounds `(0,0)` slot. Pure indexing + storage — no `BitReader` use;
  the differential `(dx, dy)` (the §6.2.3 Reading A/B-ambiguous T02 wire
  decode) is caller-supplied. Verified against the wiki grid positions,
  the §6.4.1 worked example through the cache path, and serial INTER_4MV
  propagation (14 unit tests).

- **Round 320 — SVQ1 motion-vector median-of-three predictor.** New
  `svq1_motion_predictor` module landing the per-block predictor of
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/06-motion-vectors.md` §6.4: the
  component-independent `MEDIAN(pl, pt, ptr)` (`median3`) over the
  previous-left / previous-top / previous-top-right neighbour MVs,
  the §6.4.2 absent-neighbour fallback (`(0,0)`-substituted median for
  two present neighbours, single-vector verbatim short-circuit for one
  present, `(0,0)` for none), and the §6.6 final-vector component clip
  to `[-32, +31]` (`clip_component` / `final_motion_vector`). Pure
  arithmetic — no `BitReader` use. The per-component differential VLC
  (T02) decode is intentionally deferred: spec/06 §6.2.3 / §6.10
  open-item 1 flags a bit-stream-affecting Reading A/B disambiguation
  pending a Validator round, and the predictor + clip arithmetic wired
  here is shared by both readings. New types `Svq1Mv` (signed half-pel
  `(x, y)` pair, `ZERO` constant) and `Neighbours` (three optional
  candidate vectors). Verified bit-exact against the §6.4.1 worked
  example (`pl=(0,0), pt=(5,17), ptr=(-9,12) → predictor=(0,12)`) plus
  tie / saturation / one-vs-two-present coverage (11 unit tests).

- **Round 315 — SVQ1 leaf stage-accumulation reconstruction.** Composes
  the already-staged mean step (`svq1_mean`), within-half codebook lookup
  (`svq1_codebook::codebook_vector_in_half`), and per-step `[0, 255]`
  clamp (`svq1_mean::saturate_u8`) into the fixed-order leaf
  reconstruction the spec pins in
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/04-multistage-vq-decoder.md` §4.5 —
  `predictor → mean → stage-1 → … → stage-N`, saturating AFTER EACH add
  (§4.5.1), written in output-raster order (§4.7.1). The composition
  order is the spec's mandate over already-pinned passes; no new
  arithmetic, constant, or codebook addressing is introduced.
  - New `svq1_reconstruct` module:
    - `reconstruct_leaf(level, half, predictor, mean, stages) ->
      Result<Vec<u8>, ReconstructError>` — the per-position §4.5 loop.
      Empty `stages` is the §4.5.4 mean-only collapse (`N = 0`); SKIP
      (`N = -1`, §4.5.5) is the caller's short-circuit, not a value of
      this function.
    - `LeafStage { stage, vec_idx }` — one decoded stage (ascending
      order per §4.2); `MAX_STAGES = 6` (§4.1).
    - `ReconstructError` — absent level (§4.1.2), mis-sized predictor
      (§4.3), stage overflow (§4.1.1), codebook-lookup failure (§4.3).
  - 11 new lib tests including the §4.8 worked example bit-exact
    (`predictor=0, mean=61, stage-1 idx=4, stage-2 idx=14` → raster
    `[55 39 50 77 / 93 81 49 46]`), the §4.8.3 intermediate rows, the
    §4.8.5 per-step-vs-deferred divergence (per-step → 230, not 255),
    inter mean-only saturation, an independent recompute sweep, and the
    four error paths; plus 1 doc test. Total: 449 lib + 7 integration
    + 14 doc = 470 (up from 438 + 7 + 13 = 458).

- **Round 310 — SVQ3 chroma DC full dequantization pipeline.** Composes
  the three already-pinned chroma DC stages into the ordered pipeline the
  wiki spec mandates in `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki`
  §"Macroblock transform and dequantization", which gives the chroma DC
  dequant expression `dc = (svq3_dequant_coeff[Q] * (block[0] >> 3)) >> 1`
  and notes "chroma DCs need to be **transformed first** using the
  [`8 8 / 8 -8`] matrix" — pinning the order transform → dequant →
  finalise.
  - New `svq3_dequant` helper:
    - `dequantize_chroma_dc_block(q: u32, block: [i32; 4]) -> [i32; 4]`
      `const fn` — chains `apply_chroma_dc_2x2_2d` (two-sided
      `M · X · M^T` transform) → `dequantize_chroma_dc` (per transformed
      sample) → `finalise_dc`, preserving the row-major 2×2 layout. No
      new matrix, constant, or arithmetic is introduced; the composition
      order is the spec's "first" mandate over already-pinned passes.
  - 7 new lib tests (independent brute-force re-derivation, explicit
    staged composition, pure-DC four-equal-outputs, transform-first
    ordering divergence, zero-input, `const`-context evaluability,
    out-of-range-quantiser panic) and 1 doc test. Total: 438 lib + 7
    integration + 13 doc = 458 (up from 431 + 7 + 12 = 450).
    `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` remains `Error::Unsupported`.

- **Round 302 — SVQ1 within-half codebook-vector accessor.** Surfaces
  the canonical *within-half* vector addressing pinned by
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/14-codebook-architecture.md` §14.5 (the
  `(level, half, stage, vec_idx, byte_idx)` convention) and §14.8 (the
  `half_payload[stage_idx * 16 * V_L + vec_idx * V_L + byte_idx]`
  arithmetic, stated as holding "regardless of hypothesis"). The
  cross-half / cross-level concatenation order remains the still-open
  §14.8 item, so these helpers operate only WITHIN a half the caller
  has isolated.
  - New `svq1_codebook` helpers:
    - `vector_byte_offset_in_half(level, stage, vec_idx) -> Option<usize>`
      `const fn` — the byte offset of stage `stage` (1-based, `1..=6`)
      entry `vec_idx` (`0..=15`) within one level half; `None` for the
      absent L=4 / L=5 levels and for out-of-range `stage` / `vec_idx`.
    - `codebook_vector_in_half(half, level, stage, vec_idx) -> Option<&[i8]>`
      — borrows the `V_L`-byte vector from a caller-supplied half slice,
      returning `None` if the offset is invalid or the half is too short.
  - 11 new lib tests (offset arithmetic vs an independent recompute over
    the full stage×vec grid, unique-and-tiling coverage, half-boundary
    alignment, short-half / absent-level / out-of-range rejection,
    `const`-context evaluability) and 2 doc tests. Total: 431 lib + 7
    integration + 12 doc = 450 (up from 420 + 7 + 10 = 437).
    `Svq1`/`Svq3` decode entry points remain unchanged.

- **Round 295 — SVQ3 two-sided transform `M · X · M^T` composition.**
  Composes the two single-sided passes (`M · X` column pass from rounds
  262/272 and `X · M^T` row pass from round 290) into the full two-sided
  transform implied by the wiki-pinned matrix
  (`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock transform
  and dequantization"). Pure functional composition of already-pinned
  helpers — no new matrix or constant — and `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame`
  continues to return `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_dequant` helpers:
    - `apply_luma_transform_2d(block: [i32; 16]) -> [i32; 16]` `const fn`
      — `apply_luma_transform_columns(apply_luma_transform_rows(block))`,
      realising `M · (X · M^T) = M · X · M^T`.
    - `apply_chroma_dc_2x2_2d(block: [i32; 4]) -> [i32; 4]` `const fn`
      — the 2×2 chroma DC analogue.
  - Consistent with both single-sided passes, no inter-pass shift, bias,
    or quantiser scaling is applied (the wiki does not enumerate any
    normalisation between passes). The composition order is matrix
    associativity, not an additional spec fact; tests corroborate against
    a brute-force `M · X · M^T` triple-loop reference and confirm the
    column-then-row ordering agrees.

- **Round 290 — SVQ3 transform row-multiply (`X · M^T`) passes.** The
  right-side mirror of the existing single-sided column passes
  (`M · X`), applying the wiki-pinned transform matrix
  (`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock transform
  and dequantization") against a block's rows instead of its columns.
  Pure arithmetic over the verbatim-pinned matrix `M`; no new bitstream
  reads, and `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_dequant` helpers:
    - `apply_luma_transform_rows(block: [i32; 16]) -> [i32; 16]`
      `const fn` — `out[r*4+c] = X[r,:] · M[c,:]` (= `(X · M^T)[r,c]`),
      reusing `apply_luma_transform_row` with
      `matrix_row = LUMA_TRANSFORM_MATRIX[c]`.
    - `apply_chroma_dc_2x2_rows(block: [i32; 4]) -> [i32; 4]` `const fn`
      — the 2×2 chroma DC analogue against `[[8, 8], [8, -8]]`.
  - The full two-sided `M · X · M^T` composition the wiki does NOT
    enumerate stays deferred until `docs/video/svq3/` pins the operand
    order and any intermediate rounding.

- **Round 282 — SVQ3 4×4 diagonal-down intra predictor.** The one
  intra predictor the wiki spec pins completely in
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Intra prediction" —
  the 4×4 diagonal-down quirk, whose fill picture
  (`a b c c / b c c c / c c c c / c c c c`) and three closed-form
  samples (`a = (left[1] + top[1]) / 2`, `b = (left[2] + top[2]) /
  2`, `c = (left[3] + top[3]) / 2`) are spelled out verbatim in the
  local mirror — lands as a new `svq3_pred` module. Round 282 is
  pixel arithmetic only — no new bitstream reads — and
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_pred` module surface:
    - `diagonal_down_sample(left_k: u8, top_k: u8) -> u8` `const fn`
      — one predicted sample, the spec's `(left[k] + top[k]) / 2`
      closed form. The spec writes a plain integer `/ 2` with no
      rounding bias; both operands are non-negative samples so the
      division is an exact floor, and the result always fits in `u8`
      (`(255 + 255) / 2 = 255`).
    - `predict_diagonal_down_4x4(left: [u8; 4], top: [u8; 4]) ->
      [u8; 16]` `const fn` — the full 4×4 predictor: derives `a` /
      `b` / `c` from neighbour indices `1` / `2` / `3` and expands
      them through the fill picture. Output is row-major
      (`out[row * 4 + col]`), matching the `svq3_scan` /
      `svq3_dequant` block layout so the eventual predicted+residual
      writeback can combine the two element-wise.
    - `DIAGONAL_DOWN_PATTERN: [u8; 16]` — the spec's fill picture
      flattened row-major; each entry selects one of the derived
      samples (`0` ⇒ `a`, `1` ⇒ `b`, `2` ⇒ `c`).
    - `DIAGONAL_DOWN_NEIGHBOUR_INDICES: [usize; 3] = [1, 2, 3]` —
      the neighbour-array indices the three closed forms consume.
      Element `0` of either neighbour array is never referenced by
      this predictor.
    - `PRED_4X4_DIM = 4` / `PRED_4X4_SAMPLES = 16` block-geometry
      constants.
  - 15 new lib tests cover: the fill-picture transcription and its
    `a×1 / b×2 / c×13` population; the neighbour-index constants;
    the geometry constants; per-sample zero / max / saturation-free
    bounds; floor division on odd sums; left/top symmetry of the
    per-sample average (swept) and of the full block predictor;
    uniform-neighbour identity swept over six values; agreement of
    the block output with the three closed forms position-by-
    position; the explicit picture-row layout against worked `a` /
    `b` / `c` values; element-0 insensitivity under noise injection;
    pattern-indexing consistency; a fully worked numeric example;
    and `const`-site usability of both helpers.
  - 2 doctest examples (one per helper) on the public surface.
  - Total tests: 402 lib + 7 integration + 6 doc = 415 (up from 387
    + 7 + 4 = 398).
  - Round 282 targeted the full intra per-block reconstruction
    composition (coefficients → dequant → inverse transform →
    predicted+residual writeback), but every remaining stage of that
    chain is doc-gapped: the 4×4 scan-order arrays (round 233's
    ambiguity note), the two-sided `M · X · M^T` transform (rounds
    262/272 deferrals), the numeric mode-to-predictor binding (the
    wiki names "diagonal down" without binding it to a `0..=4` mode
    value), the remaining H.264-back-referenced predictors (16×16
    plane "transposed", chroma "always DC"), and the writeback clamp
    all await pinning in `docs/video/svq3/`. The diagonal-down
    predictor is the one intra-path stage the docs fully pin that
    was still missing; it supplies the "predicted" operand of the
    eventual writeback.

- **Round 272 — SVQ3 4×4 luma transform application helpers.** The 4×4
  luma transform matrix the wiki spec
  (`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock transform
  and dequantization") pins under "Transform coefficients" as
  `[[13,17,1,7],[13,7,-1,-17],[13,-7,-1,17],[13,-17,1,-7]]` (already
  exposed verbatim as [`svq3_dequant::LUMA_TRANSFORM_MATRIX`]) now has a
  per-block application surface mirroring round 262's chroma DC helpers.
  Round 272 is structural arithmetic only — no new bitstream reads — and
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_dequant` module surface:
    - `apply_luma_transform_row(matrix_row: [i32; 4], a: i32, b: i32, c:
      i32, d: i32) -> i32` `const fn` — one matrix-row dot product
      against a 4-point column `[a, b, c, d]`:
      `matrix_row[0]*a + matrix_row[1]*b + matrix_row[2]*c +
      matrix_row[3]*d`. Because every row shares the column-0 value
      [`svq3_dequant::LUMA_TRANSFORM_DC_COLUMN`] = `13`, a pure-DC column
      `[a, 0, 0, 0]` yields `13 * a` for every row.
    - `apply_luma_transform_columns(block: [i32; 16]) -> [i32; 16]`
      `const fn` — applies `LUMA_TRANSFORM_MATRIX` against the columns of
      a row-major 4×4 input block (the `M · X` single-sided pass).
      Input/output are row-major (`block[r*4 + c]` = sample at `(r, c)`);
      `out[r*4 + c] = M[r, :] · X[:, c]`. The unrounded i32 outputs feed
      directly into [`svq3_dequant::dequantize_coefficient`].
  - 9 new lib tests cover: all-ones-column weight summing; pure-DC
    column reducing to `13 * a` swept over six `a` values across all
    four rows; explicit per-row worked dot products against `[1,2,3,4]`
    (`78`, `-44`, `64`, `-46`); row linearity under doubling/negation;
    the all-zero block identity; pure-DC column repeating `13*a` down
    every output row; a single-active-column block matching the per-row
    dot; full-block linearity under doubling and negation; the
    decomposition agreeing with the row helper position-by-position over
    an arbitrary block; and the `const fn` annotation usable in a `const`
    site.
  - 2 doctest examples (one per helper) on the public surface.
  - Total tests: 387 lib + 7 integration + 4 doc = 398 (up from 377 + 7
    + 2 = 386).
  - The full two-sided `M · X · M^T` luma transform — which the wiki
    spec does NOT spell out explicitly — is deliberately NOT folded in
    here; that derivation belongs in a future round once docs pin it.

- **Round 262 — SVQ3 2×2 chroma DC transform application helper.** The
  per-block application of the 2×2 chroma DC transform matrix the wiki
  spec pins in `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock
  transform and dequantization" as `[[8, 8], [8, -8]]` (also exposed
  verbatim as [`svq3_dequant::CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX`]) lands as two
  new `const fn` helpers in the existing `svq3_dequant` module. The wiki
  spec states "chroma DCs need to be transformed first using the
  following matrix" before the [`svq3_dequant::dequantize_chroma_dc`]
  expression is applied; round 262 implements the matrix application
  step as the single-sided `M · X` pass (the unambiguous form `M` alone
  produces against a column vector). Round 262 is structural arithmetic
  only — no new bitstream reads — and `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame`
  continues to return `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_dequant` module surface:
    - `apply_chroma_dc_transform_row(matrix_row: [i32; 2], a: i32, b:
      i32) -> i32` `const fn` — one matrix-row dot product against a
      2-point column. For the first matrix row `[8, 8]` the result is
      `8 * (a + b)`; for the second matrix row `[8, -8]` the result is
      `8 * (a - b)`. Caller passes `CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX[0]` /
      `CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX[1]` for the spec's two rows.
    - `apply_chroma_dc_2x2_columns(block: [i32; 4]) -> [i32; 4]`
      `const fn` — applies `CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX` against the
      columns of a row-major 2×2 input block (the `M · X` single-sided
      pass). The input layout matches
      [`svq3_scan::place_chroma_dc_2x2`]'s row-major output (`block[0]`
      = `(0,0)`, `block[1]` = `(0,1)`, `block[2]` = `(1,0)`, `block[3]`
      = `(1,1)`); the return value is laid out the same way. The
      per-position output is:
      `out[0,0] = 8 * (block[0,0] + block[1,0])`,
      `out[0,1] = 8 * (block[0,1] + block[1,1])`,
      `out[1,0] = 8 * (block[0,0] - block[1,0])`,
      `out[1,1] = 8 * (block[0,1] - block[1,1])`. Suitable for direct
      consumption by the per-sample dequant step that follows.
  - 18 new lib tests cover: row-0 sum-of-pair semantics swept across
    six representative `(a, b)` pairs; row-1 difference-of-pair
    semantics over the same sweep; explicit worked `row · (3, 1)`
    examples (`32` for row 0; `16` for row 1); the all-zero-block
    identity; four single-position-active-bit inputs (top-row,
    bottom-row, diagonal, anti-diagonal); the all-ones block's
    sum-cancelling-difference behaviour; linearity under doubling and
    under negation; the top-row-only / bottom-row-only branch
    asymmetries; per-row column-wise sum / difference identities; the
    `const fn` annotation usable at compile time (a `const OUT: [i32;
    4]` site); and a cross-module sanity case feeding a
    [`svq3_scan::place_chroma_dc_2x2`] output through
    `apply_chroma_dc_2x2_columns`.
  - 2 doctest examples (one per helper) on the public surface.
  - Total tests: 377 lib + 7 integration + 2 doc = 386 (up from 359 + 7
    = 366).
  - The full two-sided `M · X · M^T` transform — which the wiki spec
    does NOT spell out explicitly — is deliberately NOT folded in here.
    That derivation belongs in a future round once docs pin it.

- **Round 245 — SVQ3 alt-scan two-half block walker.** The typed
  two-half walker for SVQ3's alternative-scan coefficient block lands as
  a new `svq3_coeff::AltScanBlock` carrier plus a
  `svq3_coeff::read_alt_scan_block` entry point. The wiki spec
  (`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Coefficient decoding")
  pins the alt-scan path as "coded in two parts of up two eight
  coefficients corresponding to each half-scan": each half is an
  independent run of up to `COEFFS_PER_ALT_SCAN_HALF` = 8 coefficients,
  terminated by either an explicit end-of-block sentinel (`code == 0`)
  or by reaching the half's capacity, and the two halves keep their
  run-accumulator cursors strictly independent.
  - New surface in `svq3_coeff`:
    - `AltScanBlock { first_half: Vec<Coefficient>, second_half:
      Vec<Coefficient> }` — typed two-half carrier with
      `len()` / `is_empty()` / `iter_with_half()` (yielding
      `(half_index: u8, Coefficient)` pairs in stream order) /
      `flatten()` (returning a single `Vec<Coefficient>` for callers
      that have already absorbed the half boundary).
    - `read_alt_scan_block(br) -> Result<AltScanBlock>` — sequences
      two `read_alt_scan_half(br)` calls back-to-back, preserving the
      half walker's per-half termination + per-half capacity
      guarantees verbatim.
  - 12 new lib tests pin the contract:
    - both halves empty (two consecutive end-of-block sentinels),
    - first-half-only / second-half-only populated patterns,
    - both halves capped at 8 coefficients each → `len() == 16`,
    - per-half cursor independence (a `(run=0, value=5)` coefficient
      in half 1 does not bleed into half 2's cursor),
    - first-half capacity-cap exit does NOT consume the second
      half's first bit,
    - `BadBitWidth` overflow propagation from either half,
    - `Truncated` propagation from either half,
    - `flatten()` preserves stream order,
    - `iter_with_half()` yields the correct `(half_index,
      Coefficient)` pairs,
    - structural invariant `2 * COEFFS_PER_ALT_SCAN_HALF ==
      COEFFS_PER_4X4_BLOCK`.
  - The per-half 8-position scan-order array the wiki spec depicts in
    §"Macroblock layer" remains deferred per round 233's ambiguity
    note; the two-half block walker landed here exposes the
    coefficient stream in the order it was emitted, leaving the
    scan-position-to-flat-index reshape to the round that pins the
    canonical interpretation in `docs/video/svq3/`.

- **Round 242 — SVQ1 per-stage codebook-index field reader (§4.2).**
  The `4 × N`-bit per-leaf codebook-index run described in
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/04-multistage-vq-decoder.md` §4.2 lands as a
  new `svq1_stage_indices` module. The reader consumes `N`
  consecutive 4-bit fields (stage-1 first, stage-`N` last) from the
  existing MSB-first `BitReader`, returns the values as an
  allocation-free `IndexBuffer` of up to six unsigned `u8`s in
  `0..=15`, and surfaces the spec's three invariants — bit-tight (no
  inter-stage padding, §4.2.1), stage-ordered (no permutation field,
  §4.2.1), raw (not VLC, §4.2.1) — through both the function
  signature and a dedicated test set.
  - New `svq1_stage_indices` module surface:
    - `BITS_PER_INDEX: u32 = 4` — per-stage field width per
      spec/04 §4.2 (table row "Width : 4 bits").
    - `MAX_STAGES_PER_LEAF: usize = 6` — upper bound on `N` per
      spec/04 §4.1 stage-count VLC alphabet `{-1, 0..=6}`. Mirrors
      `svq1_codebook::SVQ1_STAGES_PER_LEVEL`.
    - `MAX_VEC_IDX: u8 = 15` — upper bound on each `vec_idx` per
      spec/14 §14.4 "16 vectors per stage" (entries `0..=15`).
    - `bits_for_n_stages(n: usize) -> Option<usize>` `const fn` —
      closed-form `4 × N` for `N ∈ 0..=6`, `None` otherwise.
    - `IndexBuffer` struct with `EMPTY` constant, `len()` /
      `is_empty()` / `indices()` / `get(stage_one_based)`
      accessors. Storage is a `[u8; 6]` plus a `len: u8`; values
      past `len` are not exposed to callers.
    - `read_stage_indices(reader, n_stages) -> Result<IndexBuffer>`
      — reads exactly `4 × n_stages` bits MSB-first; rejects
      `n_stages > MAX_STAGES_PER_LEAF` with `Error::BadBitWidth`;
      returns `IndexBuffer::EMPTY` for `n_stages == 0` without
      consuming any bits (mean-only leaf path per spec/04 §4.5.4);
      propagates `Error::Truncated` if the underlying byte slice
      ends mid-run.
  - Twenty-seven new lib tests cover the closed-form arithmetic
    (`bits_for_n_stages` over the full `0..=7` range), the empty
    buffer's accessor invariants, the degenerate cases (zero stages
    consumes no bits; seven or more stages rejected with
    `BadBitWidth(n)`), each edge of the single-stage value range
    (`0`, `5`, `15`), the multi-stage byte-boundary-crossing cases
    (two-stage byte read, three-stage 12-bit read straddling byte
    0/1, six-stage 24-bit read consuming the spec's "3 bytes
    worth"), the per-stage all-zeros / all-fifteens edges, the
    no-inter-stage-padding invariant via `bits_consumed`
    accounting, the continuation read (post-reader cursor lands at
    the exact bit immediately after the last stage's last bit), the
    three truncation paths (mid-stream, first-stage, mid-third-
    stage), the `IndexBuffer::get` one-based indexing convention
    (`get(0)` returns `None`), and the cross-module
    `MAX_STAGES_PER_LEAF == SVQ1_STAGES_PER_LEVEL` consistency
    invariant.
  - Round 242 is the bitstream-side index reader alone. It does
    NOT perform the §4.3 codebook lookup
    (`(level, half, stage, vec_idx) → V_L signed bytes`) — that
    step still depends on the L=0..L=3 payload's intra-vs-inter /
    stage-vs-level interleave being pinned in `docs/video/svq1/`
    (`crates/oxideav-svq/src/svq1_codebook.rs` "Open work" note).
    Once that interleave lands, the per-leaf decoder will call
    `svq1_stage_indices::read_stage_indices` and feed the returned
    `IndexBuffer` into the codebook-offset arithmetic.

- **Round 239 — SVQ1 mean-step saturating arithmetic.** The per-sample
  mean-step apply arithmetic documented in
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/05-mean-removal.md` §5.4 lands as a new
  `svq1_mean` module. The two halves of the SVQ1 mean family — intra
  (`u8 ∈ [0, 255]` per §5.1.1) and inter (`s9 ∈ [-256, +255]` per
  §5.1.2 / §5.1.3) — are exposed as `const fn` helpers, with the
  underlying clamp matching the wiki spec's "saturate to an unsigned
  byte range, 0..255" mandate (§5.4.3). Round 239 is pure arithmetic —
  no bitstream reads — the future mean-VLC wire-up round will read the
  intra (alphabet 256) and inter (alphabet 512, `min_value = -256`)
  mean-VLC tables per spec/05 §5.7 and feed the decoded mean into
  these helpers.
  - New `svq1_mean` module surface:
    - `INTRA_MEAN_MIN: u8 = 0` and `INTRA_MEAN_MAX: u8 = 255` — the
      intra mean range per spec/05 §5.1.1.
    - `INTER_MEAN_MIN: i16 = -256` and `INTER_MEAN_MAX: i16 = 255` —
      the inter mean range per spec/05 §5.1.2 / §5.1.3.
    - `saturate_u8(value: i16) -> u8` `const fn` — the per-stage
      clamp to the unsigned byte range `[0, 255]` per spec/05 §5.4.3.
    - `apply_intra_mean_step(predictor: u8, mean: u8) -> u8` `const
      fn` — the intra path's per-sample mean step. The canonical case
      has `predictor = 0` per spec/05 §5.4.1.
    - `apply_inter_mean_step(predictor: u8, mean: i16) -> Result<u8,
      MeanError>` `const fn` — the inter path's per-sample mean step.
      The predictor is the motion-compensated reference sample; the
      `saturate_u8` clamp is load-bearing on this path per the
      spec/05 §5.1.2 worked examples (`predictor = 0`, `mean = -256`
      → 0; `predictor = 255`, `mean = +255` → 255).
    - `samples_per_leaf(level: Svq1Level) -> Option<usize>` `const
      fn` — the `V_L` replication count per spec/03 §3.3 (`8 / 16 /
      32 / 64` for L=0..L=3; `None` for L=4 / L=5 since those levels
      do not host a mean-removed VQ leaf per spec/14.10 / §14.11).
    - `MeanError::OutOfRange(i16)` — typed error for inter mean
      values outside the closed `[-256, +255]` domain.
  - Twelve new unit tests in `svq1_mean::tests` cover the boundary
    behaviour: `saturate_u8` below-zero / above-255 / pass-through
    sweep across `[0, 255]`; intra mean-only with `predictor = 0`
    using the spec/05 §5.9 worked-example value `mean = 61` plus the
    range boundaries; intra mean with a non-zero predictor exercising
    the clamp; inter mean negative-residue / positive-residue
    saturation per spec/05 §5.1.2's two worked examples; inter
    `mean = 0` returns the predictor unchanged for every predictor
    in `[0, 255]`; inter out-of-range rejection at `-257` / `+256`;
    `samples_per_leaf` matches spec/03 §3.3's `V_L` numbers for
    L=0..L=3 and returns `None` for L=4 / L=5; intra and inter
    range-constant values match spec/05 §5.1.
  - Total tests: 319 lib + 7 integration = 326 (up from 307 + 7 =
    314).

- **Round 233 — SVQ3 per-block coefficient placement (scan-order
  infrastructure).** The per-block placement step that connects the
  Golomb-decoded `(run, value)` coefficient stream from `svq3_coeff`
  to the 2D block matrix consumed by the dequantization arithmetic in
  `svq3_dequant` lands as a new `svq3_scan` module. Round 233 is
  structural arithmetic only —
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported` until the 4×4 dezigzag + IDCT
  stages land.
  - New `svq3_scan` module surface:
    - `CHROMA_DC_2X2_SCAN: [usize; 4] = [0, 1, 2, 3]` — the
      unambiguous row-major 2×2 chroma DC scan order. The wiki spec's
      §"Coefficient decoding" notes that "chroma DCs are stored in
      2×2 blocks" without drawing a dezigzag picture for the 2×2
      case; for a 2×2 block stored row-major the row-major /
      column-major / diagonal scan orders all collapse to the same
      four-position list.
    - `CHROMA_DC_2X2_LEN = 4` and `FULL_4X4_LEN = 16` — placement-side
      block-capacity constants mirroring the
      `crate::svq3_coeff::COEFFS_PER_*` lengths.
    - `chroma_dc_2x2_flat_index(row, col) -> Option<usize>` `const fn`
      and its inverse `chroma_dc_2x2_matrix_position(flat) ->
      Option<(usize, usize)>` `const fn` — round-trip helpers
      converting between 2×2 matrix `(row, col)` positions and the
      4-entry row-major flat-index store.
    - `ScanError` enum (`OutOfRange` / `InvalidScanOrderEntry` /
      `ScanOrderLengthMismatch`) — typed errors the placement helpers
      raise when the input coefficient stream's cursor would overrun
      the destination, when the scan-order table contains an
      out-of-range entry, or when the scan-order table's length does
      not match the destination's capacity. Implements `Display` +
      `std::error::Error`.
    - `place_coefficients_in_scan_order::<DEST_LEN>(coeffs,
      scan_order) -> Result<[i32; DEST_LEN], ScanError>` — generic
      `(run, value)` stream → fixed-size flat-array placement helper.
      Initialises the destination to all zeros, advances a placement
      cursor by `coeff.run + 1` per non-zero coefficient per the wiki
      spec's §"Coefficient decoding" semantics, and writes the
      coefficient's signed `value` at the scan-order position
      `cursor + run` mapped through the supplied scan-order table.
    - `place_chroma_dc_2x2(coeffs) -> Result<[i32; 4], ScanError>` —
      convenience wrapper pinned to `CHROMA_DC_2X2_SCAN` /
      `CHROMA_DC_2X2_LEN`. Returns the 4-entry block in row-major
      order so its output feeds directly into the
      `svq3_dequant::CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX = [[8, 8], [8, -8]]`
      application.
  - +24 lib tests covering: the 2×2 row-major scan-order identity-mapping
    invariant; the 2×2 scan length-vs-capacity agreement; the
    scan-position covers-every-position-exactly-once invariant; the
    scan-position → matrix `(row, col)` decoding for all four entries;
    the `chroma_dc_2x2_flat_index` round-trip + out-of-range-row +
    out-of-range-col rejection guards; the
    `chroma_dc_2x2_matrix_position` out-of-range-flat-index rejection;
    placement of an empty stream → all-zero block; single-coefficient
    placement at each `run` value `(0, 1, 3)`; multi-coefficient
    placement with zero-run + non-zero-run sequences; full-block fill
    via four consecutive run=0 coefficients; negative-value sign
    preservation through placement; cursor-overrun rejection at
    in-stream `run`, cumulative-run, and saturated-`u32::MAX` boundaries;
    scan-order length-mismatch and out-of-range scan-entry rejection
    paths; generic-scan-order placement against a permuted 4-entry table;
    generic-scan-order empty-stream identity for any scan order; and
    `ScanError` `Display` impl sanity (`oxideav-svq:` module prefix
    and offending-value mention). Lib-test total: 283 → 307 (290 →
    314 with the 7 standalone-mode integration test).
  - The wiki's §"Macroblock layer" "Dezigzag pattern (from H.264)"
    ASCII art for the 4×4 scan order is NOT transcribed in round 233:
    the picture has two unresolved characteristics — (a) row-0
    horizontal arrows connect `(0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)`, matching neither
    the H.264 frame-zigzag opening triple `(0,0)→(0,1)→(1,0)` nor the
    H.264 alt-scan opening triple `(0,0)→(1,0)→(0,1)`; (b) the wiki
    text uses "normal zigzag" as the not-this-picture case without
    depicting it. Both 4×4 scan-order arrays are deferred to a future
    docs round that pins their canonical interpretation.

- **Round 230 — SVQ3 macroblock transform + dequantization arithmetic.**
  The per-coefficient dequantization arithmetic the wiki spec defines
  for SVQ3 in `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock
  transform and dequantization" lands as a new `svq3_dequant` module.
  Round 230 is structural arithmetic only —
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported` until the dezigzag + IDCT stages
  land.
  - New `svq3_dequant` module surface:
    - `LUMA_TRANSFORM_MATRIX: [[i32; 4]; 4]` — verbatim from the wiki
      spec's four-row block
      `[[13, 17, 1, 7], [13, 7, -1, -17], [13, -7, -1, 17], [13, -17,
      1, -7]]`.
    - `LUMA_TRANSFORM_DC_COLUMN = 13` — corroborates the all-rows-share-
      `13`-in-column-0 invariant.
    - `CHROMA_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX: [[i32; 2]; 2]` — verbatim from the
      wiki spec's `[[8, 8], [8, -8]]` block.
    - `DEQUANT_COEFF_TABLE: [u32; 32]` — the 32-entry per-quantiser
      scale table, monotonically increasing from `3881` at `Q=0` to
      `141_533` at `Q=31`.
    - `DEQUANT_COEFF_TABLE_LEN = 32` /
      `DEQUANT_QUANTISER_RANGE = 0..32` — length and quantiser-range
      constants matching the slice header's 5-bit quantiser field.
    - `INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE = 259_922` (= `13 * 13 * 1538`) /
      `INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE_TAIL = 1538` — the spec's intra-luma-DC
      scale and its standalone tail factor.
    - `DEQUANT_SHIFT = 20` / `DEQUANT_ROUND = 0x80000 = 1 << 19` —
      the general dequant's right-shift and round-half-up bias.
    - `CHROMA_DC_PRE_SHIFT = 3` / `CHROMA_DC_POST_SHIFT = 1` — the
      two chroma-DC shifts that total `>> 4` (matching the `8`-scaled
      chroma transform matrix).
    - `dequantize_intra_luma_dc(block_zero) -> i32` `const fn` —
      applies `INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE * block_zero`, the spec's
      `13 * 13 * 1538 * block[0]` expression for intra luma blocks
      without separate DC coefficient blocks.
    - `dequantize_chroma_dc(q, block_zero) -> i32` `const fn` —
      applies `(DEQUANT_COEFF_TABLE[q] * (block_zero >> 3)) >> 1`,
      the spec's chroma-DC expression.
    - `dequantize_coefficient(q, coeff, dc) -> i32` `const fn` —
      applies `(coeff * DEQUANT_COEFF_TABLE[q] + dc + 0x80000) >> 20`,
      the spec's general per-coefficient dequant expression.
    - `finalise_dc(dc) -> i32` `const fn` — applies
      `(dc + DEQUANT_ROUND) >> DEQUANT_SHIFT`, the no-AC-contribution
      shortcut equivalent to `dequantize_coefficient(_, 0, dc)`.
  - +40 lib tests covering the luma transform matrix shape +
    row-by-row verbatim content + first-column invariant + row-sum
    invariant, the chroma DC transform matrix verbatim content and
    its per-row sums (16 / 0), the 32-entry dequant table's
    length-vs-quantiser-range agreement + first/last entry +
    every-row verbatim content + strict-monotonicity sweep, the
    `DEQUANT_SHIFT = 20` and `DEQUANT_ROUND = 0x80000` provenance
    identities, the `INTRA_LUMA_DC_SCALE = 13 * 13 * 1538 = 259_922`
    decomposition, the chroma-shift total `>> 4` identity, every
    closed-form helper's zero / one / negative / boundary
    arithmetic checks, the `finalise_dc` round-half-up boundary, a
    monotonic-output-in-quantiser sweep for `dequantize_coefficient`,
    and linearity-in-coeff / additivity-in-dc identities (243 → 283
    lib-test total; 250 → 290 lib + integration).

- **Round 224 — SVQ3 sub-pixel thirdpel interpolation arithmetic.** The
  per-sample interpolation arithmetic the wiki spec defines for SVQ3
  motion compensation in
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Motion Compensation"
  lands as a new `svq3_mc` module. Round 224 is structural arithmetic
  only — `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` continues to return
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`.
  - New `svq3_mc` module surface:
    - `thirdpel_interpolate_1d(a, b) -> i32` `const fn` —
      `((2 * A + B + 1) * 0x2AB) >> 11`.
    - `thirdpel_interpolate_2d(a, b, c, d) -> i32` `const fn` —
      `((4 * A + 3 * B + 3 * C + 2 * D + 6) * 0xAAB) >> 15`.
    - `THIRDPEL_1D_MULTIPLIER = 0x2AB` (683) / `THIRDPEL_1D_SHIFT = 11`
      / `THIRDPEL_1D_BIAS = 1` / `THIRDPEL_1D_WEIGHT_SUM = 3`
      provenance constants.
    - `THIRDPEL_2D_MULTIPLIER = 0xAAB` (2731) / `THIRDPEL_2D_SHIFT = 15`
      / `THIRDPEL_2D_BIAS = 6` / `THIRDPEL_2D_WEIGHT_SUM = 12`
      provenance constants.
    - `THIRDPEL_2D_WEIGHTS: [[u8; 2]; 2] = [[4, 3], [3, 2]]` — the
      verbatim weight matrix the wiki spec quotes.
    - `stored_sixths_base(precision) -> u32` — returns 6 / 3 / 2 for
      Fullpel / Halfpel / Thirdpel, per the wiki spec's "stored and
      predicted as fraction of six and then rounded to the desired
      base" remark.
    - `is_aligned_to_precision_base(stored_sixths, precision) -> bool`
      — checks whether an already-rounded sixths-grid value is on the
      precision's base. The actual rounding step is NOT implemented
      because the wiki spec text leaves the rounding direction
      unspecified.
  - +31 tests covering the multiplier / shift / bias constants, the
    weight matrix and its sum, the fixed-point reciprocal ratios
    (`683 * 3 = 2049 > 2048`, `2731 * 12 = 32772 > 32768`), formula
    expansion matches for zero / equal / asymmetric inputs, exhaustive
    `0..=255 × 0..=255` byte-range coverage for the 1D form,
    representative-spread byte-range coverage for the 2D form, the
    per-precision storage base lookup, and the alignment predicate
    against negative and positive sixths-grid values (212 → 243
    lib-test total; 219 → 250 lib + integration).

- **Round 217 — SVQ1 u16-LE parameter table (512 records) mirrored.**
  The 1024-byte `u16` parameter table identified by the docs
  collaborator's Extractor 02 pass at file offset `0x59d00..0x5a100`
  (VMA `0x67dc9d00..0x67dca100`, section `.rdata`) is now mirrored
  bit-exact under `crates/oxideav-svq/tables/u16_param_table.{csv,
  meta}` and exposed via the existing `svq1_helper_luts` module:
  - `build.rs` gains a `parse_u16_csv` helper (sister of the
    existing `parse_unsigned_csv`) that asserts the `word_index`
    column is gapless `0..512`, parses the `value_u16` column, and
    emits a `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE: [u16; 512]` static.
  - New `svq1_helper_luts` surface:
    - `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE: [u16; 512]` static (1024 bytes total).
    - `u16_param_table() -> &'static [u16]` accessor.
    - `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_WORDS = 512` /
      `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_BYTES = 1024` length constants.
    - `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_FILE_OFFSET = 0x0005_9d00` /
      `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_VMA = 0x67dc_9d00` provenance constants.
    - `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_ALLOWED_VALUES: [u16; 16]` — the closed
      ascending allowed-value set the meta enumerates
      (`{0x0000, 0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0010, 0x0014, 0x0020, 0x0028,
      0x0048, 0x0068, 0x0081, 0x0082, 0x0084, 0x0101, 0x0102,
      0x0181, 0x0182}`).
  - Seven new lib tests cover length-vs-meta, the source-region
    offsets / image-base derivation, the flush-against-clip-LUT
    geometry (`u16_end_vma == SVQ1_CLIP_LUT_VMA`), the
    every-value-is-in-allowed-set closed-set invariant, the
    four-word zero prelude at `word_index 0..4`, the first
    non-zero `0x0020 × 9` group head at `word_index 4..13`, and a
    strictly-ascending-uniqueness guard over
    `SVQ1_U16_PARAM_TABLE_ALLOWED_VALUES`.
  - `tables/MANIFEST-02.sha256` extended with the two new file
    SHA-256s; both match `docs/video/svq1/tables/MANIFEST-02.sha256`
    bit-for-bit.
  - The table is NOT yet wired into a decode path — exposed for
    the future pixel-reconstruction stage to lift in unchanged.
  - Total tests: 212 lib + 7 integration = 219 (up from 212).
- **Round 203 — SVQ1 saturating-clip + bit-mask helper LUTs.**
  Two small helper LUTs identified by the docs collaborator's
  Extractor 02 pass in the SVQ1 `.rdata` region are now mirrored
  bit-exact under `crates/oxideav-svq/tables/` and exposed as
  compile-time constants via a new `svq1_helper_luts` module:
  - **Saturating-clip LUT** — 768 bytes at reference-binary file
    offset `0x5a100..0x5a400` (VMA `0x67dca100..0x67dca400`,
    section `.rdata`). New `tables/clip_lut.{csv,meta}`. Per the
    meta this is the codec's interpolation / overflow-saturation
    helper — explicitly NOT a VQ codebook.
  - **Bit-position / bit-mask LUT** — 16 bytes at file offset
    `0x5c1c4..0x5c1d4` (VMA `0x67dcc1c4..0x67dcc1d4`). New
    `tables/svc_bitmask_lut.{csv,meta}`. First 8 entries are the
    descending single-bit masks
    `0x80, 0x40, 0x20, 0x10, 0x08, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01`; last 8 are
    their one's complements
    `0x7f, 0xbf, 0xdf, 0xef, 0xf7, 0xfb, 0xfd, 0xfe`.
  - `build.rs` gains a `parse_unsigned_csv` helper (sister of the
    existing signed-byte CSV parser) that asserts `byte_index` is
    gapless `0..N`, parses the `value_unsigned` column as `u8`,
    and emits `SVQ1_CLIP_LUT: [u8; 768]` + `SVQ1_BITMASK_LUT:
    [u8; 16]` alongside the existing `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_L0L3_BYTES`
    / `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_DESCRIPTOR` / `SVQ1_BLOCK_SHAPE_LUT` /
    `SVQ1_L{4,5}_ABSENCE` constants.
  - New `svq1_helper_luts` module exposes:
    - `SVQ1_CLIP_LUT: [u8; 768]` static
    - `SVQ1_BITMASK_LUT: [u8; 16]` static
    - `clip_lut() -> &'static [u8]` accessor
    - `bitmask_lut() -> &'static [u8]` accessor
    - `SVQ1_CLIP_LUT_BYTES = 768`, `SVQ1_BITMASK_LUT_BYTES = 16`
    - `SVQ1_CLIP_LUT_FILE_OFFSET = 0x0005_a100`,
      `SVQ1_CLIP_LUT_VMA = 0x67dc_a100`,
      `SVQ1_BITMASK_LUT_FILE_OFFSET = 0x0005_c1c4`,
      `SVQ1_BITMASK_LUT_VMA = 0x67dc_c1c4`
  - Eight new lib tests cover length-vs-meta, the descending-mask
    half, the one's-complement half, the documented 16-byte
    bitmask string, the clip-LUT identity-ramp head at offset
    `0x10..0x20` (`0x80..0x8f`), and the derivable image base
    `0x67d70000` (VMA − file-offset) for both LUT regions.
  - `tables/MANIFEST-02.sha256` extended with the four new file
    SHA-256s, matching `docs/video/svq1/tables/MANIFEST-02.sha256`.
  - Total lib tests rise to 205 (was 197); integration tests
    unchanged at 7.

- **Round 197 — SVQ1 L=4 / L=5 codebook ABSENCE wired end-to-end.**
  The docs collaborator's Extractor 02 pass
  (`docs/video/svq1/spec/14.10-codebook-L4.md`,
  `spec/14.11-codebook-L5.md`,
  `tables/codebook-l{4,5}.meta`,
  `provenance/02-codebook-extraction.md`) RESOLVED the L=4 / L=5
  codebook gap as **architecturally absent**: no codebook exists at
  16×8 or 16×16 in the reference build; both block sizes are always
  subdivided to ≤8×8 before quantisation.
  - New crate-local `tables/codebook-l4.meta` + `codebook-l5.meta`
    bit-exact mirrors of `docs/video/svq1/tables/`.
  - `build.rs` now parses the two new meta files at build time;
    a new `parse_absent_meta` helper asserts `status: ABSENT` +
    `level` / `block_size` / `canonical_vector_len_bytes` /
    `canonical_6stage_intra_or_inter_bytes` against the per-level
    invariants (L=4 → `4 / 16x8 / 128 / 12288`; L=5 →
    `5 / 16x16 / 256 / 24576`). A future docs revision that flips
    `status` to "present" or quietly changes the canonical sizes
    fails the build before any consumer relies on the `None`
    branch.
  - New `Svq1AbsentLevelRecord` typed struct
    (`{ level, block_size, canonical_vector_len_bytes,
       canonical_6stage_intra_or_inter_bytes }`).
  - New `pub const SVQ1_L4_ABSENCE: Svq1AbsentLevelRecord` and
    `pub const SVQ1_L5_ABSENCE: Svq1AbsentLevelRecord` populated by
    `build.rs` from the meta files.
  - New `Svq1Level::absence_record() -> Option<Svq1AbsentLevelRecord>`
    `const fn`. Returns `Some(SVQ1_L{4,5}_ABSENCE)` for the
    always-subdivided levels and `None` for L=0..L=3. Documented
    invariant: `absence_record().is_some() ==
    codebook_bytes_per_half().is_none()` for every level.
  - 5 new unit tests in `svq1_codebook::tests` covering the
    `SVQ1_L4_ABSENCE` / `SVQ1_L5_ABSENCE` constants
    (level / block_size / vec_len / per-half), the per-half byte
    count vs vector_length identity, the `absence_record` accessor
    (L=4 / L=5 → Some, L=0..L=3 → None), and the
    `absence_record.is_some() ⇔ codebook_bytes_per_half.is_none()`
    invariant.
  - 7 new integration tests in
    `tests/svq1_codebook_l4_l5_absence.rs` exercising the full
    end-to-end absence contract — `Svq1Level::L4` /
    `Svq1Level::L5` reporting absent through every public surface,
    `Svq1Level::L0..L3` reporting present, the
    `read_block_decision` walker rejecting in-place quantisation
    at L=4 / L=5 with the typed
    `Error::InvalidLevelQuantise(level)` variant (with the level
    field roundtripping through `absence_record()`), the
    block-shape LUT capping at 4 corroborating the absence, and
    the four absence-surface predicates agreeing on every level.
  - Total tests: 197 lib + 7 integration = 204 (was 192 → +12).
  - **Deferred** — the internal intra-vs-inter ordering and
    stage-vs-level interleave WITHIN the 23004-byte L=0..L=3
    payload remains a sibling docs spec task per
    `docs/video/svq1/CODEBOOK_GAP.md` "remaining open work" note.
    Full pixel reconstruction still waits on that layout doc.

- **Round 9 — SVQ1 L=0..L=3 codebook payload landed.** The 23004-byte
  mean-removed multistage VQ payload + 36-byte descriptor/block-shape
  prefix from `docs/video/svq1/tables/` (Extractor 02, file offset
  `0x5d200..0x62c00` of the reference binary `quicktimethirdparty.qtx`
  SHA-256 `ac3509bf22aa1458dfc6e1af980956c0153b4c287af452ae5b9cac6f923be169`)
  are now compile-time constants in a new `svq1_codebook` module.
  - New crate-local `tables/` directory mirrors
    `docs/video/svq1/tables/{codebook-l0l3,codebook-descriptor}.{csv,hex,meta}`
    + `MANIFEST-02.sha256` bit-exact so the in-repo CI checkout can
    build without reaching out to the docs submodule.
  - New `build.rs` parses the two CSVs (`value_signed` column) at
    build time and emits `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_L0L3_BYTES: [i8; 23004]`,
    `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_DESCRIPTOR: [u8; 36]`,
    `SVQ1_BLOCK_SHAPE_LUT: [u8; 16]` under `$OUT_DIR/`.
  - `svq1_codebook::Svq1Level::codebook_bytes_per_half()` const
    method returns `Some(768)` / `Some(1536)` / `Some(3072)` /
    `Some(6144)` for L=0..L=3 (one half — intra OR inter) and `None`
    for L=4 / L=5. Per-half × 2 summed across L=0..L=3 is
    `2 × (768 + 1536 + 3072 + 6144) = 23040 B`, matching the
    `36 B descriptor + 23004 B payload` region total.
  - Public accessors: `codebook_l0l3_payload() -> &'static [i8]`,
    `codebook_descriptor() -> &'static [u8]`, `block_shape_lut() ->
    &'static [u8]`.
  - Public size constants: `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_PAYLOAD_BYTES = 23004`,
    `SVQ1_CODEBOOK_DESCRIPTOR_BYTES = 36`,
    `SVQ1_BLOCK_SHAPE_LUT_LEN = 16`, `SVQ1_STAGES_PER_LEVEL = 6`,
    `SVQ1_ENTRIES_PER_STAGE = 16`.
  - 11 unit tests cover payload + descriptor lengths, the
    full-region size arithmetic, per-level byte counts, L=4 / L=5
    `None` rejection, the 16-entry block-shape LUT against the exact
    byte string `04 04 03 02 04 03 03 02 03 03 02 02 03 02 02 01`
    recorded in `codebook-descriptor.meta` line 22, the LUT cap at
    `1..=4` (corroborating the §14.10 / §14.11 ABSENT findings), the
    first descriptor record's `(b0=0x03, b3=0x18, b4=0x02)` byte
    pattern, the first 16 i8 entries against `codebook-l0l3.hex` row
    1, and accessor aliasing. Total tests now 192 (was 181).
  - **Deferred** — Round 9 deliberately does NOT yet expose a
    `(level, stage, intra_or_inter, vector_idx) → &[i8]` lookup.
    The precise intra-vs-inter ordering and stage-vs-level interleave
    WITHIN the 23004-byte payload is a sibling docs spec task per
    `docs/video/svq1/tables/codebook-l0l3.meta` lines 30-32 ("the
    L0..L3 spec's concern"). Full pixel reconstruction unblocks when
    the internal-layout spec lands. The L=4 / L=5 codebook bytes
    themselves are confirmed ABSENT in this build per
    `docs/video/svq1/spec/14.10-codebook-L4.md` and
    `docs/video/svq1/spec/14.11-codebook-L5.md` — there is nothing
    to add for those levels.

- **Round 8 — SVQ1 block-tree subdivision walker (structural).** The
  recursive subdivide-vs-quantise decision tree described in
  `docs/video/svq1/wiki/Sorenson_Video_1.wiki` §"Decoding Intraframe
  Plane Data" lands as a new `svq1_blocktree` module. The walker
  reads ONE bit per level at L=1..=L=5 (1 ⇒ subdivide, 0 ⇒ quantise),
  short-circuits the L=0 base case to "quantise" with no bit
  consumed, and rejects the 0-bit (in-place quantise) branch at L=4
  / L=5 with a new dedicated error variant. The L=4 / L=5 rejection
  is corroborated by the newly-staged clean-room codebook-extraction
  docs `docs/video/svq1/spec/14.10-codebook-L4.md` and
  `docs/video/svq1/spec/14.11-codebook-L5.md`, both of which
  resolve to "no codebook stored at this level in the Sorenson Video
  TM for QT R2.0 build — the level is always subdivided".
  - `svq1_blocktree::Svq1Level { L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 }` —
    typed level enum with `block_dims()` / `vector_length()` /
    `rejects_in_place_quantise()` const methods matching the wiki
    spec's level table (4×2 / 4×4 / 8×4 / 8×8 / 16×8 / 16×16; 8 /
    16 / 32 / 64 / 128 / 256 samples; `true` only at L=4 / L=5).
  - `svq1_blocktree::Svq1BlockDecision { Subdivide, Quantise }` —
    typed result of one block-tree node.
  - `svq1_blocktree::read_block_decision(level, &mut BitReader) ->
    Result<Svq1BlockDecision>` — one-bit walker; L=0 short-circuits
    to `Quantise` without reading a bit; L=4 / L=5 0-bit returns
    `Error::InvalidLevelQuantise(level)`.
  - `svq1_blocktree::subdivide(Svq1Level) -> Option<(Svq1Level,
    Svq1Level)>` — `const fn` returning the two child levels for
    any non-leaf level, `None` at L=0.
  - `Error::InvalidLevelQuantise(Svq1Level)` — new error variant
    surfacing the wiki spec's "invalid vector, error out of decode
    since levels 4 and 5 blocks do not use multistage VQ"
    condition. Mapped to `oxideav_core::Error::InvalidData` via the
    existing `From<crate::Error> for oxideav_core::Error` impl.
  - 13 unit tests covering the level table, vector-length table,
    every per-level subdivide/quantise/truncation path, the
    L=4 / L=5 rejection, and a worked 7-bit breadth-first walk.
  - Round 8 stays structural — the per-leaf "stages count VLC +
    mean VLC + (stages × 4)-bit codebook selector" payload
    remains gated on the L=0..L=3 codebook layout / VLC table
    work tracked in `docs/video/svq1/CODEBOOK_GAP.md`.

- **Round 7 — SVQ3 intra-4×4 predictor-from-neighbour resolution
  helper.** The per-sub-block predictor lookup described in
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Intra macroblock
  information decoding" — `pred_table[top + 1][left + 1][idx]` plus
  the two substitution rules ("when predictors lie outside of slice,
  -1 is used instead", "for 16x16 intra and any inter blocks value of
  2 is used as the predictor") — is now a typed helper in the
  `svq3_mb` module.
  - `svq3_mb::IntraNeighbour { Outside, Intra16x16OrInter, Mode4x4(u8) }`
    — typed neighbour classification carrying the substitution rule
    information.
  - `svq3_mb::IntraNeighbour::lookup_index() -> Result<u8>` — returns
    the `0..=5` index along the table's first / second axis after the
    spec's `+ 1` adjustment, honouring both substitution rules. Errors
    with `Error::BadBitWidth` when `Mode4x4(mode > 4)` is passed.
  - `svq3_mb::resolve_intra_4x4_predictor(top, left, idx) ->
    Result<u8>` — performs the table lookup. Returns the resolved
    intra-prediction mode `0..=4` on success; returns the new
    `Error::InvalidIntraPrediction(top_idx, left_idx, idx)` when the
    looked-up entry is the `-1` sentinel (spec: "input data was
    incorrect or intra modes were predicted incorrectly"); returns
    `Error::BadBitWidth` when `idx > 4`.
  - `svq3_mb::resolve_intra_4x4_pair(top, left, (a, b)) ->
    Result<(u8, u8)>` — walks both elements of an `INTRA_PRED_PAIRS`
    entry against the same neighbour context.
  - `Error::InvalidIntraPrediction(u8, u8, u8)` — new error variant
    surfacing the spec's "table value is -1" malformed-bitstream
    condition. Mapped to `oxideav_core::Error::InvalidData` via the
    existing `From<crate::Error> for oxideav_core::Error` impl.

- **Round 6 — SVQ3 inter-MB motion-vector precision selector.** The
  three-branch decision described in
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Inter macroblock
  information decoding" is now a typed reader in the `svq3_mb` module.
  The selector consumes 0, 1, or 2 bits depending on the sequence
  header's `has_thirdpel` / `has_halfpel` flags and returns one of
  three precisions. B-frame inter macroblocks short-circuit to halfpel
  per the spec's §"Macroblock transform and dequantization" remark
  ("it is always halfpel precision in B-frames") and consume no bit.
  - `svq3_mb::Svq3MvPrecision { Fullpel, Halfpel, Thirdpel }` — typed
    sample-grid precision result.
  - `svq3_mb::read_inter_mv_precision_p_frame(br, has_thirdpel,
    has_halfpel) -> Result<Svq3MvPrecision>` — implements the
    three-branch selector verbatim from the wiki spec for P-frame inter
    macroblocks. Bit-consumption pattern: 0 bits when both flags off,
    1 bit when exactly one flag is set, 1-2 bits when both flags are
    set.
  - `svq3_mb::read_inter_mv_precision(br, frame_type, has_thirdpel,
    has_halfpel) -> Result<Svq3MvPrecision>` — frame-type dispatch that
    short-circuits B-frames to halfpel without reading any bit and
    defers P-frame inter to the standalone reader.

- **Round 5 — SVQ3 residual coefficient walker.** The per-block
  Golomb-coded `(run, value)` residual coefficient stream described in
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Coefficient decoding"
  lands in the new `svq3_coeff` module. Three coefficient-table
  variants (2×2 chroma DC, alternative-scan 4×4 luma-intra-with-low-
  quantiser, normal-zigzag everything else) plus the two run-correction
  arrays (`intra_run`, `inter_run`) are implemented verbatim from the
  wiki spec. The block-level walkers loop until either the end-of-block
  sentinel (`code = 0`) is seen or the block's coefficient capacity is
  reached; structural overflow returns `Error::BadBitWidth`. Round 5
  remains structural — de-zigzag, dequantisation, and IDCT remain out
  of scope.
  - `svq3_coeff::read_chroma_dc_coefficient` /
    `read_alt_scan_coefficient` / `read_normal_scan_coefficient` —
    decode one coefficient (Golomb code + sign bit) per call,
    returning `Ok(None)` on end-of-block / `Ok(Some(Coefficient))`
    otherwise / `Err(Error::Truncated)` on short input.
  - `svq3_coeff::read_chroma_dc_block` / `read_alt_scan_half` /
    `read_normal_scan_block` — block-level walkers that gather the
    `Coefficient` triples up to the per-block coefficient cap (4 /
    8 / 16) and surface structural overflow as
    `Error::BadBitWidth(scan_position)`.
  - `Coefficient { run: u32, value: i32 }` typed result struct.
  - `INTRA_RUN_CORRECTION: [i32; 8]` and
    `INTER_RUN_CORRECTION: [i32; 17]` — the two run-correction arrays
    landed verbatim, with the `[minus ones]` / `[zeroes]` shorthand
    tails handled by the per-table extension formulas.
  - `ALT_SCAN_TABLE_0_15: [(u32, i32); 16]` and
    `NORMAL_SCAN_TABLE_0_15: [(u32, i32); 16]` — verbatim
    transcriptions of the wiki spec's first 16 rows.
  - `COEFFS_PER_4X4_BLOCK = 16`, `COEFFS_PER_CHROMA_DC_BLOCK = 4`,
    `COEFFS_PER_ALT_SCAN_HALF = 8` — block-capacity constants.
  - +36 tests covering single-coefficient table lookups (explicit
    codes + closed-form extensions for both alt-scan and normal-scan),
    sign-bit application, end-of-block sentinel detection, block-
    walker capacity caps, run-overflow rejection, and truncation
    propagation (105 → 141 total).

- **Round 4 — SVQ3 macroblock-type tree walk (structural).** The
  per-macroblock type-Golomb decode + classification from
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock layer"
  lands in the new `svq3_mb` module, alongside the intra-prediction
  pair / context-lookup tables and the 4×4 intra scan order from
  §"Intra macroblock information decoding". Round 4 remains
  structural — the macroblock body past the type code (CBP / intra
  mode pair / motion vectors / residual coefficients) is **not**
  decoded; the decoder handle still returns
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported` from `receive_frame`.
  - `svq3_mb::read_mb_type(&mut BitReader, Svq3FrameType) ->
    Result<Svq3MbType>` — reads a single `ue(v)` exp-Golomb code at
    the bit-reader's current position and classifies it against the
    enclosing slice's frame type per the wiki spec table.
  - `svq3_mb::classify_mb_type(Svq3FrameType, u32) ->
    Result<Svq3MbType>` — pre-decoded-code variant for callers that
    need to expose the raw value for CBP / mode-pair follow-up.
  - `Svq3MbType` enum with five variants: `IIntra(IFrameMbType)`,
    `PInter(PFrameInterMode)`, `PIntra(IFrameMbType)`,
    `BInter(BFrameInterMode)`, `BIntra(IFrameMbType)`. Carries the
    underlying I-frame intra MB type for P / B intra MBs after
    peeling the per-slice intra offset (`P_FRAME_INTRA_OFFSET = 8`,
    `B_FRAME_INTRA_OFFSET = 4`).
  - `IFrameMbType` enum: `LumaDcSeparate` (code 0),
    `PredefinedCbpMode(u32)` (codes 1..=24, raw value preserved),
    `LumaDcSeparateNoOthers` (code 25).
  - `PFrameInterMode` enum: `Skip`, `Inter16x16`, `Inter8x16`,
    `Inter16x8`, `Inter8x8`, `Inter4x8`, `Inter8x4`, `Inter4x4`
    (codes 0..=7).
  - `BFrameInterMode` enum: `Direct`, `Forward`, `Backward`,
    `Bidirectional` (codes 0..=3).
  - Predicate helpers: `Svq3MbType::is_intra()` / `is_inter()` /
    `is_skip()` / `num_motion_vectors()` / `intra()` — let the
    downstream residual / MC stage classify without rebuilding the
    enum match.
  - `INTRA_PRED_PAIRS: [(u8, u8); 25]` — the wiki spec's 4×4
    intra-mode pair table in the documented triangular listing
    order. Round 4 lands the table verbatim for a future intra-mode
    Golomb-walk stage.
  - `INTRA_PRED_TABLE: [[[i8; 5]; 6]; 6]` — the wiki spec's
    `pred_table[top + 1][left + 1][idx]` context-lookup table.
    Stored as `i8` so the `-1` sentinel ("out-of-slice predictor"
    per the wiki spec) is representable.
  - `INTRA_4X4_SCAN_ORDER: [u8; 16]` — the wiki spec's 4×4 intra
    sub-block scan order (`(0, 1)(4, 5) … (10, 11)(14, 15)`)
    flattened row-major.
  - Per-slice constants: `I_FRAME_MB_TYPE_MAX = 25`,
    `P_FRAME_MB_TYPE_MAX = 33`, `B_FRAME_MB_TYPE_MAX = 29`,
    `P_FRAME_INTRA_OFFSET = 8`, `B_FRAME_INTRA_OFFSET = 4`.
  - +24 tests covering: I/P/B-frame code-table classification
    (exhaustive), out-of-range rejection, Golomb-decode round trips
    for representative codes in each frame type, MV-count predicate
    correctness, intra-table shape + sentinel + invariants, scan
    order permutation check. Total crate test count
    81 → 105 (+24).

- **Round 3 — SVQ3 SEQH + slice-header parser (structural).** The
  SVQ3 sequence-header (`SEQH` extradata) and per-slice header
  parsers from
  `docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Sequence Header" /
  §"Slice Header" land in the new `svq3` module, and the SVQ3 `SVQ3`
  FourCC is registered alongside SVQ1 in
  `oxideav_core::CodecRegistry`. Round 3 is structural-only —
  `Svq3DecoderHandle::receive_frame` returns
  `oxideav_core::Error::Unsupported`; the macroblock layer (motion
  compensation, Golomb-coded residual) is out of round-3 scope.
  - `svq3::SVQ3_SEQH_MAGIC` (`"SEQH"`) + `svq3::SVQ3_FRAME_END`
    (`0xFF`) constants.
  - `svq3::strip_seqh_prefix(&[u8])` — validates the 4-byte SEQH
    marker + 4-byte big-endian length and returns the payload slice.
  - `svq3::parse_sequence_header(&[u8]) -> Result<Svq3SequenceHeader>`
    — walks the bit-packed `3 + (24)? + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + (1+8)* + 1`
    layout and returns the typed sequence header. The 7-entry
    `FRAME_SIZE_TABLE` lookup is shared with the SVQ1 parser; the
    code-7 escape reads 12+12-bit explicit dimensions.
  - `svq3::parse_extradata(&[u8])` — convenience wrapper combining
    the two steps above.
  - `svq3::num_macroblocks(&Svq3SequenceHeader)` — derives the
    macroblock count from the parsed sequence header (used by the
    v2 slice-header to compute the macroblock-offset field width).
  - `svq3::unpermute_slice_payload(body, slice_size_size)` — reverses
    the wiki spec's `"first 0-2 bytes ... stored at the very end of
    the slice"` permutation. The further "may be further scrambled"
    descramble step is deferred until the algorithm is documented.
  - `svq3::parse_slice_header(unpermuted_body, version,
    slice_size_size, slice_size, num_mbs, protected)` — parses the
    Golomb-coded frame-code (`0=P`, `1=B`, `2=I`), the
    version-dependent `has_more_slices_v1` / `mb_offset_v2` field,
    the 8-bit frame number, 5-bit slice quantiser, delta-qp /
    unknown / protected-unknown flags, and the optional-byte
    trailer loop. Returns a typed `Svq3SliceHeader`.
  - `svq3::parse_wire_slice(wire_slice, num_mbs, protected)` —
    end-to-end helper: reads the 1-byte version/size-size prefix +
    1-3 byte slice-size field, unpermutes the body, parses the
    slice header, and surfaces the macroblock-layer remainder for
    future use.
  - `svq3::read_ue_golomb(&mut BitReader)` — unsigned exp-Golomb
    decoder (`ue(v)`) per the wiki spec's "extensively uses Golomb
    coding" note + the "based on an early H.264 draft" provenance.
  - `Svq3FrameType` / `SliceVersion` enums + `Svq3SequenceHeader`
    / `Svq3SliceHeader` structs typing every wiki-spec'd field.
  - Registry: `SVQ3_CODEC_ID_STR = "svq3"`, `SVQ3_FOURCC_CODES =
    [b"SVQ3"]`, `make_svq3_decoder` factory, `probe_svq3` probe
    accepting any first-byte whose high 3 bits land in 1..=3 and
    whose low 5 bits decode to version 1 or 2.
  - `Svq3DecoderHandle` implementing `oxideav_core::Decoder`:
    `send_packet` parses the slice header eagerly (or accepts the
    `0xFF` frame-end sentinel without parsing); `receive_frame`
    returns `Error::Unsupported`; `sequence_header()` /
    `last_slice_header()` accessors expose parsed state for
    integrators. The extradata is parsed eagerly at construction.
  - +29 tests covering the new SEQH + slice-header + permutation +
    Golomb paths, the SVQ3 registry registration, and the
    decoder-handle state machine. Total crate test count
    52 → 81 (+29).

- **Round 2 — `oxideav-core` framework integration.** The structural
  SVQ1 frame-header parser is now wired into the framework registry.
  - Default-on `registry` cargo feature gating the `oxideav-core`
    dependency. With `default-features = false` the crate exposes only
    the standalone `parse_frame_header` / `Svq1FrameHeader` / `BitReader`
    / `Error` surface.
  - `register(&mut RuntimeContext)` / `register_codecs(&mut
    CodecRegistry)` entry points plus the `__oxideav_entry` symbol the
    `oxideav_core::register!` macro expands to.
  - `Svq1DecoderHandle` implementing `oxideav_core::Decoder`:
    `send_packet` parses the frame header eagerly (structural failures
    surface at `send_packet` rather than later); the parsed
    `Svq1FrameHeader` is exposed via `Svq1DecoderHandle::last_header()`.
    `receive_frame` returns `Error::Unsupported` because the codebook
    docs-gap is still open.
  - `probe_svq1(&ProbeContext)` registered alongside the FourCC tags:
    `1.0` on a structurally valid header, `0.5` on a truncated header
    or on the no-packet case (FourCC alone is highly disambiguating),
    `0.0` on a structurally invalid header.
  - `From<crate::Error> for oxideav_core::Error` conversion mapping
    every structural failure to `InvalidData(msg)` with a descriptive
    string; `NotImplemented` maps to `Unsupported`.
  - FourCC declarations: `SVQ1` (canonical, also covers `svq1` since
    `CodecTag::fourcc` upper-cases) and `svqi`, sourced from line 9 of
    `docs/video/svq1/wiki/Sorenson_Video_1.wiki`.
  - Inline `ci-standalone` GitHub Actions job exercising the
    `--no-default-features` build + test path so regressions where a
    standalone module accidentally re-imports `oxideav-core` are caught
    at PR time.

- **Round 1 — SVQ1 frame-header parser.** `parse_frame_header` walks
  the bit-packed SVQ1 chunk header documented in
  `docs/video/svq1/wiki/Sorenson_Video_1.wiki` §"Stream Format And
  Header" and returns a typed `Svq1FrameHeader`. Coverage:
  - 22-bit `frame_code` + the `(frame_code & 0x60) == 0`
    invalid-stream check.
  - 8-bit `temporal_reference`.
  - 2-bit `picture_type` (decoded to `Svq1PictureType::Intra` /
    `Predicted` / `Droppable`); value `3` rejected per spec.
  - I-frame trailer chain: optional 16-bit checksum on frame codes
    `0x50` / `0x60`; optional XOR-obfuscated embedded ASCII string
    when `frame_code ^ 0x10 > 0x50` (captured raw, length-prefixed);
    the 2 + 2 + 1 "unknown" sub-fields; 3-bit `frame_size_code`;
    explicit 12 + 12 width/height on code `7`.
  - 1-bit `checksum_present` flag and its `use_packet:1 +
    component:1 + reserved2:2` (reserved2 must be 0) trailer.
  - 1-bit `unknown_flag_1` flag, its 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 fixed-width
    sub-fields, and the `while next-bit-is-1 { read 8 bits }`
    variable-length tail.
  - `FRAME_SIZE_TABLE` constant for the seven standard dimensions.
  - `SVQ1_FOURCC_CODES` constant listing the three FourCC codes the
    spec attaches to SVQ1.
  - MSB-first `BitReader` sized for the header fields.
- Structural error variants: `InvalidFrameCode`,
  `InvalidPictureType`, `InvalidChecksumTrailer`, `Truncated`,
  `BadBitWidth`; the round-0 `NotImplemented` sentinel remains
  available for unwired API surfaces.

### Notes

- **Docs gap (SVQ1 codebooks, still tracked):** the SVQ1 multi-stage
  VQ codebooks and per-level VLC tables enumerated in the wiki
  spec's "Appendix A: SVQ1 Data Tables" are not yet pinned in
  `docs/`. The encoded plane-data layer is blocked on that data
  landing in `docs/video/svq1/spec/` or `docs/video/svq1/tables/`.
- **Docs gap (SVQ3 macroblock layer):** the wiki spec's
  §"Macroblock layer" + §"Intra macroblock information decoding"
  type-tree + intra-mode pair table + context-lookup table are now
  covered by round 4. Still open downstream of those: the wiki
  spec's §"Coefficient decoding" tables 1/2/3 (handed-off-but-not-
  yet-implemented data tables for the three Golomb-codeword
  branches), §"Inter macroblock information decoding" MV component
  VLC bit-listing (the wiki spec describes the precision-selector
  but not the VLC table itself), §"Macroblock transform and
  dequantization" quantizer table (present in the wiki as
  `svq3_dequant_coeff`; can land alongside coefficient decoding),
  and §"Intra prediction" (mostly a back-reference to H.264 plus
  the three named SVQ3-specific quirks).
- **SVQ3 protected-stream watermark sub-record:** the wiki spec
  describes the byte layout but the variable-length-code encoding
  of the watermark width / height / unknown fields is not pinned,
  and the deflated watermark image's role as decryption input is
  out of round-3 scope. Captured at a structural level via
  `Svq3SequenceHeader::protected`.
- **SVQ3 slice descramble:** the wiki spec's note "Additionally
  slice data may be further scrambled probably in order to prevent
  unauthorised playback" is not yet pinned in `docs/`; round 3
  applies the documented byte-permutation step (first 0-2 bytes
  moved to slice trailer) but not the additional descramble.

### Provenance

Round 1 was implemented strictly from
`docs/video/svq1/wiki/Sorenson_Video_1.wiki` §"Stream Format And
Header". Round 2 added line 9 (FourCC list) from the same file and
the `oxideav-core` public API (`Decoder` / `CodecRegistry` /
`CodecParameters` / `Packet` / `ProbeContext` / `register!` macro).
Round 3 was implemented strictly from
`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Sequence Header" /
§"Slice Header" / §"Packetization" (a verbatim local mirror of the
multimedia.cx Sorenson_Video_3 wiki page, fetched 2026-05-06,
CC-BY-SA per multimedia.cx terms). The SVQ1 wiki file's
`FRAME_SIZE_TABLE` is re-used by the SVQ3 parser (the two formats
share the seven standard dimension pairs).

Round 4 was implemented strictly from
`docs/video/svq3/wiki/Sorenson_Video_3.wiki` §"Macroblock layer" /
§"Intra macroblock information decoding" of the same local mirror.
No additional spec documents were opened during round 4.

No external library source,
no archived `old` branch of this crate, and no online cross-checks
were consulted in any of the four rounds.

## [0.0.1] — Round 0 — clean-room rebuild scaffold

### Changed

- Clean-room rebuild from a fresh orphan `master`. The previous
  implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
  2026-05-06; the prior history is preserved on the `old` branch.
  See `README.md` for the rebuild scope and the strict-isolation
  workspace the Implementer rounds will draw from.
